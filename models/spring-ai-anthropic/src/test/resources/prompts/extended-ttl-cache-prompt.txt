This system prompt is specifically designed for testing extended TTL caching strategies and contains sufficient tokens
to trigger Anthropic's prompt caching mechanism with Claude Sonnet 4 (1024+ token threshold). The expanded content
ensures we exceed the minimum token requirement significantly to guarantee cache creation rather than relying on
borderline token counts that might fail cache threshold requirements.
