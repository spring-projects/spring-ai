= Observability

Spring AI builds upon the observability features in the Spring ecosystem to provide insights into AI-related operations.
Spring AI provides metrics and tracing capabilities for its core components: `ChatClient` (including `Advisor`),
`ChatModel`, `EmbeddingModel`, `ImageModel`, and `VectorStore`.

NOTE: Low cardinality keys will be added to metrics and traces, while high cardinality keys will only be added to traces.

== Chat Client

The `spring.ai.chat.client` observations are recorded when a ChatClient `call()` or `stream()` operations are invoked. 
They measure the time spent performing the invocation and propagate the related tracing information.

|Name | Description
|`gen_ai.operation.name` | Always `framework`.
|`gen_ai.system` | Always `spring_ai`.
|`spring.ai.chat.client.stream` | Is the chat model response a stream - `true or false`
|`spring.ai.kind` | The kind of framework API in Spring AI: `chat_client`.

=== Input Data

The `ChatClient` input data is typically big and possibly containing sensitive information.
For those reasons, it is not exported by default.

Spring AI supports exporting input data as span attributes across all tracing backends.

[cols="6,3,1"]

| Property | Description | Default
| `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.include-input` |  Whether to include the input content in the observations. | `false`

WARNING: If you enable the inclusion of the input content in the observations, there's a risk of exposing sensitive or private information. Please, be careful!

=== Chat Client Advisors

The `spring.ai.advisor` observations are recorded when a call or stream around advisors is performed. 
They measure the time spent in the advisor (including the time spend on the inner advisors) and propagate the related tracing information.

=== Chat Prompt and Completion Data

The chat prompt and completion data is typically big and possibly containing sensitive information.
For those reasons, it is not exported by default.

Spring AI supports exporting chat prompt and completion data as span events if you use an OpenTelemetry tracing backend,
whereas data is exported as span attributes if you use an OpenZipkin tracing backend.

Furthermore, Spring AI supports logging chat prompt and completion data, useful for troubleshooting scenarios.

WARNING: If you enable the inclusion of the chat prompt and completion data in the observations, there's a risk of exposing sensitive or private information. Please, be careful!

== EmbeddingModel

NOTE: Observability features are currently supported only for `EmbeddingModel` implementations from the following
AI model providers: Azure OpenAI, Mistral AI, Ollama, and OpenAI.
Additional AI model providers will be supported in a future release.
