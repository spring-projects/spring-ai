== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M6


=== Changes to Usage Interface and DefaultUsage Implementation

The `Usage` interface and its default implementation `DefaultUsage` have undergone the following changes:

1. Method Rename:
* `getGenerationTokens()` is now `getCompletionTokens()`

2. Type Changes:
* All token count fields in `DefaultUsage` changed from `Long` to `Integer`:
** `promptTokens`
** `completionTokens` (formerly `generationTokens`)
** `totalTokens`

==== Required Actions

* Replace all calls to `getGenerationTokens()` with `getCompletionTokens()`

* Update `DefaultUsage` constructor calls:
[source,java]
----
// Old (M5)
new DefaultUsage(Long promptTokens, Long generationTokens, Long totalTokens)

// New (M6)
new DefaultUsage(Integer promptTokens, Integer completionTokens, Integer totalTokens)
----


NOTE: For more information on handling Usage, refer xref:api/usage-handling.adoc[here]

==== JSON Ser/Deser changes
While M6 maintains backward compatibility for JSON deserialization of the `generationTokens` field, this field will be removed in M7. Any persisted JSON documents using the old field name should be updated to use `completionTokens`.

Example of the new JSON format:
[source,json]
----
{
  "promptTokens": 100,
  "completionTokens": 50,
  "totalTokens": 150
}
----

=== Changes to usage of FunctionCallingOptions for tool calling

Each `ChatModel` instance, at construction time, accepts an optional `ChatOptions` or `FunctionCallingOptions` instance
that can be used to configure default tools used for calling the model.

Before 1.0.0-M6:

- any tool passed via the `functions()` method of the default `FunctionCallingOptions` instance was included in
each call to the model from that `ChatModel` instance, possibly overwritten by runtime options.
- any tool passed via the `functionCallbacks()` method of the default `FunctionCallingOptions` instance was only
made available for runtime dynamic resolution (see xref:api/tools.adoc#_tool_resolution[Tool Resolution]), but never
included in any call to the model unless explicitly requested.

Starting 1.0.0-M6:

- any tool passed via the `functions()` method or the `functionCallbacks()` of the default `FunctionCallingOptions`
instance is now handled in the same way: it is included in each call to the model from that `ChatModel` instance,
possibly overwritten by runtime options. With that, there is consistency in the way tools are included in calls
to the model and prevents any confusion due to a difference in behavior between `functionCallbacks()` and all the other options.

If you want to make a tool available for runtime dynamic resolution and include it in a chat request to the model only
when explicitly requested, you can use one of the strategies described in xref:api/tools.adoc#_tool_resolution[Tool Resolution].

NOTE: 1.0.0-M6 introduced new APIs for handling tool calling. Backward compatibility is maintained for the old APIs across
all scenarios, except the one described above. The old APIs are still available, but they are deprecated
and will be removed in 1.0.0-M7.

=== Removal of deprecated Amazon Bedrock chat models

Starting 1.0.0-M6, Spring AI transitioned to using Amazon Bedrock's Converse API for all Chat conversation implementations in Spring AI.
All the Amazon Bedrock Chat models are removed except the Embedding models for Cohere and Titan.

NOTE: Refer to xref:api/chat/bedrock-converse.adoc[Bedrock Converse] documentation for using the chat models.

=== Changes to use Spring Boot 3.4.2 for dependency management

Spring AI updates to use Spring Boot 3.4.2 for the dependency management. You can refer https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v3.4.2/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/build.gradle[here] for the dependencies which Spring Boot 3.4.2

==== Required Actions

* If you are upgrading to Spring Boot 3.4.2, please make sure to refer to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.4-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-33[this] documentation for the changes required to configure the REST Client. Notably, if you donâ€™t have an HTTP client library on the classpath, this will likely result in the use of `JdkClientHttpRequestFactory` where `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` would have been used previously. To switch to use `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory`, you need to set `spring.http.client.factory=simple`.
* If you are using a different version of Spring Boot (say Spring Boot 3.3.x) and need a specific version of a dependency, you can override it in your build configuration.

=== Vector Store API changes

In version 1.0.0-M6, the `delete` method in the `VectorStore` interface has been modified to be a void operation instead of returning an `Optional<Boolean>`.
If your code previously checked the return value of the delete operation, you'll need to remove this check.
The operation now throws an exception if the deletion fails, providing more direct error handling.

==== Before 1.0.0-M6:
[source,java]
----
Optional<Boolean> result = vectorStore.delete(ids);
if (result.isPresent() && result.get()) {
    // handle successful deletion
}
----

==== In 1.0.0-M6 and later:
[source,java]
----
vectorStore.delete(ids);
// deletion successful if no exception is thrown
----

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M5

* Vector Builders have been refactored for consistency.
* Current VectorStore implementation constructors have been deprecated, use the builder pattern.
* VectorStore implementation packages have been moved into unique package names, avoiding conflicts across artifact.  For example `org.springframework.ai.vectorstore` to `org.springframework.ai.pgvector.vectorstore`.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.RC3

* The type of the portable chat options (`frequencyPenalty`, `presencePenalty`, `temperature`, `topP`) has been changed from `Float` to `Double`.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M2

* The configuration prefix for the Chroma Vector Store has been changes from `spring.ai.vectorstore.chroma.store` to `spring.ai.vectorstore.chroma` in order to align with the naming conventions of other vector stores.

* The default value of the `initialize-schema` property on vector stores capable of initializing a schema is now set to `false`.
This implies that the applications now need to explicitly opt-in for schema initialization on supported vector stores, if the schema is expected to be created at application startup.
Not all vector stores support this property.
See the corresponding vector store documentation for more details.
The following are the vector stores that currently don't support the `initialize-schema` property.

1. Hana
2. Pinecone
3. Weaviate

* In Bedrock Jurassic 2, the chat options `countPenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, and `presencePenalty`
have been renamed to `countPenaltyOptions`, `frequencyPenaltyOptions`, and `presencePenaltyOptions`.
Furthermore, the type of the chat option `stopSequences` have been changed from `String[]` to `List<String>`.

* In Azure OpenAI, the type of the chat options `frequencyPenalty` and `presencePenalty`
has been changed from `Double` to `Float`, consistently with all the other implementations.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M1

On our march to release 1.0.0 M1 we have made several breaking changes.  Apologies, it is for the best!

=== ChatClient changes

A major change was made that took the 'old' `ChatClient` and moved the functionality into `ChatModel`.  The 'new' `ChatClient` now takes an instance of `ChatModel`. This was done do support a fluent API for creating and executing prompts in a style similar to other client classes in the Spring ecosystem, such as `RestClient`, `WebClient`, and `JdbcClient`.  Refer to the [JavaDoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/docs/api) for more information on the Fluent API, proper reference documentation is coming shortly.

We renamed the 'old' `ModelClient` to `Model` and renamed implementing classes, for example `ImageClient` was renamed to `ImageModel`.  The `Model` implementation represent the portability layer that converts between the Spring AI API and the underlying AI Model API.

### Adapting to the changes

NOTE: The `ChatClient` class is now in the package `org.springframework.ai.chat.client`

#### Approach 1

Now, instead of getting an Autoconfigured `ChatClient` instance, you will get a `ChatModel` instance.  The `call` method signatures after renaming remain the same.
To adapt your code should refactor you code to change use of the type `ChatClient` to `ChatModel`
Here is an example of existing code before the change

```java
@RestController
public class OldSimpleAiController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    public OldSimpleAiController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", this.chatClient.call(message));
    }
}
```

Now after the changes this will be

```java
@RestController
public class SimpleAiController {

    private final ChatModel chatModel;

    public SimpleAiController(ChatModel chatModel) {
        this.chatModel = chatModel;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", this.chatModel.call(message));
    }
}
```

NOTE: The renaming also applies to the classes
* `StreamingChatClient` -> `StreamingChatModel`
* `EmbeddingClient` -> `EmbeddingModel`
* `ImageClient` -> `ImageModel`
* `SpeechClient` -> `SpeechModel`
* and similar for other `<XYZ>Client` classes

#### Approach 2

In this approach you will use the new fluent API available on the 'new' `ChatClient`

Here is an example of existing code before the change

```java
@RestController
class OldSimpleAiController {

    ChatClient chatClient;

    OldSimpleAiController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
	}

	@GetMapping("/ai/simple")
	Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
		return Map.of(
                "generation",
				this.chatClient.call(message)
        );
	}
}
```

Now after the changes this will be

```java
@RestController
class SimpleAiController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    SimpleAiController(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
      this.chatClient = builder.build();
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of(
                "generation",
				this.chatClient.prompt().user(message).call().content()
        );
    }
}
```


NOTE: The `ChatModel` instance is made available to you through autoconfiguration.

#### Approach 3

There is a tag in the GitHub repository called [v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/tree/v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes) that you can checkout and do a local build to avoid updating any of your code until you are ready to migrate your code base.

```bash
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes

./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```


=== Artifact name changes

Renamed POM artifact names:
- spring-ai-qdrant -> spring-ai-qdrant-store
- spring-ai-cassandra -> spring-ai-cassandra-store
- spring-ai-pinecone -> spring-ai-pinecone-store
- spring-ai-redis -> spring-ai-redis-store
- spring-ai-qdrant -> spring-ai-qdrant-store
- spring-ai-gemfire -> spring-ai-gemfire-store
- spring-ai-azure-vector-store-spring-boot-starter -> spring-ai-azure-store-spring-boot-starter
- spring-ai-redis-spring-boot-starter -> spring-ai-redis-store-spring-boot-starter

== Upgrading to 0.8.1

Former `spring-ai-vertex-ai` has been renamed to `spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2` and `spring-ai-vertex-ai-spring-boot-starter` has been renamed to `spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2-spring-boot-starter`.

So, you need to change the dependency from

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

and the related Boot starter for the Palm2 model has changed from

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

to

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* Renamed Classes (01.03.2024)

** VertexAiApi -> VertexAiPalm2Api
** VertexAiClientChat -> VertexAiPalm2ChatClient
** VertexAiEmbeddingClient -> VertexAiPalm2EmbeddingClient
** VertexAiChatOptions -> VertexAiPalm2ChatOptions

== Upgrading to 0.8.0

=== January 24, 2024 Update

* Moving the `prompt` and `messages` and `metadata` packages to subpackages of `org.sf.ai.chat`
* New functionality is *text to image* clients. Classes are `OpenAiImageModel` and `StabilityAiImageModel`. See the integration tests for usage, docs are coming soon.
* A new package `model` that contains interfaces and base classes to support creating AI Model Clients for any input/output data type combination. At the moment the chat and image model packages implement this. We will be updating the embedding package to this new model soon.
* A new "portable options" design pattern. We wanted to provide as much portability in the `ModelCall` as possible across different chat based AI Models. There is a common set of generation options and then those that are specific to a model provider. A sort of "duck typing" approach is used. `ModelOptions` in the model package is a marker interface indicating implementations of this class will provide the options for a model. See `ImageOptions`, a subinterface that defines portable options across all text->image `ImageModel` implementations. Then `StabilityAiImageOptions` and `OpenAiImageOptions` provide the options specific to each model provider. All options classes are created via a fluent API builder all can be passed into the portable `ImageModel` API. These option data types are using in autoconfiguration/configuration properties for the `ImageModel` implementations.

=== January 13, 2024 Update

The following OpenAi Autoconfiguration chat properties has changed

* from `spring.ai.openai.model` to `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.model`.
* from `spring.ai.openai.temperature` to `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.temperature`.

Find updated documentation about the OpenAi properties: https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chat/openai-chat.html

=== December 27, 2023 Update

Merge SimplePersistentVectorStore and InMemoryVectorStore into SimpleVectorStore
* Replace InMemoryVectorStore with SimpleVectorStore

=== December 20, 2023 Update

Refactor the Ollama client and related classes and package names

* Replace the org.springframework.ai.ollama.client.OllamaClient by org.springframework.ai.ollama.OllamaModelCall.
* The OllamaChatClient method signatures have changed.
* Rename the org.springframework.ai.autoconfigure.ollama.OllamaProperties into org.springframework.ai.autoconfigure.ollama.OllamaChatProperties and change the suffix to: `spring.ai.ollama.chat`. Some of the properties have changed as well.

=== December 19, 2023 Update

Renaming of AiClient and related classes and package names

* Rename AiClient to ChatClient
* Rename AiResponse to ChatResponse
* Rename AiStreamClient to StreamingChatClient
* Rename package org.sf.ai.client to org.sf.ai.chat

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M4

* PaLM API support removal

As a follow up to the announcement to https://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/deprecation[deprecate PaLM API], the PaLM API support is removed.
