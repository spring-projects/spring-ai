[[upgrading-to-1-0-0-snapshot]]
== Upgrading to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

=== Overview
The 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version includes significant changes to artifact IDs, package names, and module structure. This section provides guidance specific to using the SNAPSHOT version.

=== Add Snapshot Repositories

To use the 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version, you need to add the snapshot repositories to your build file.
For detailed instructions, refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#snapshots-add-snapshot-repositories[Snapshots - Add Snapshot Repositories] section in the Getting Started guide.

=== Update Dependency Management

Update your Spring AI BOM version to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` in your build configuration.
For detailed instructions on configuring dependency management, refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#dependency-management[Dependency Management] section in the Getting Started guide.

=== Artifact ID, Package, and Module Changes
The 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT includes changes to artifact IDs, package names, and module structure.

For details, refer to:
- xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#common-artifact-id-changes[Common Artifact ID Changes]
- xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#common-package-changes[Common Package Changes]
- xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#common-module-structure[Common Module Structure]

[[automating-upgrading-using-ai]]
=== Automating upgrading using AI

You can automate the upgrade process to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT using the Claude Code CLI tool with a provided prompt. The prompt will guide the AI to perform the following tasks:

1. Update the Spring AI BOM version to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
2. Ensure all required repositories exist in your build configuration
3. Update Spring AI artifact IDs according to the new naming patterns

To use this automation:

1. Download the https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview[Claude Code CLI tool]
2. Copy the prompt from the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/src/prompts/update-to-snapshot.txt[update-to-snapshot.txt] file
3. Paste the prompt into the Claude Code CLI
4. The AI will analyze your project and make the necessary changes

This approach can save time and reduce the chance of errors when upgrading multiple projects or complex codebases.

[[upgrading-to-1-0-0-m8]]
== Upgrading to 1.0.0-M8

* The `PromptTemplate` API has been redesigned to support a more flexible and extensible way of templating prompts, relying on a new `TemplateRenderer` API. As part of this change, the `getInputVariables()` and `validate()` methods have been deprecated and will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if called. Any logic specific to a template engine should be available through the `TemplateRenderer` API.

[[upgrading-to-1-0-0-m7]]
== Upgrading to 1.0.0-M7

=== Overview of Changes
Spring AI 1.0.0-M7 is the last milestone release before the RC1 and GA releases. It introduces several important changes to artifact IDs, package names, and module structure that will be maintained in the final release.

=== Artifact ID, Package, and Module Changes
The 1.0.0-M7 includes the same structural changes as 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.

For details, refer to:
- xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#common-artifact-id-changes[Common Artifact ID Changes]
- xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#common-package-changes[Common Package Changes]
- xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#common-module-structure[Common Module Structure]

=== MCP Java SDK Upgrade to 0.9.0

Spring AI 1.0.0-M7 now uses MCP Java SDK version 0.9.0, which includes significant changes from previous versions. If you're using MCP in your applications, you'll need to update your code to accommodate these changes.

Key changes include:

==== Interface Renaming

* `ClientMcpTransport` → `McpClientTransport`
* `ServerMcpTransport` → `McpServerTransport`
* `DefaultMcpSession` → `McpClientSession` or `McpServerSession`
* All `*Registration` classes → `*Specification` classes

==== Server Creation Changes

* Use `McpServerTransportProvider` instead of `ServerMcpTransport`

[source,java]
----
// Before
ServerMcpTransport transport = new WebFluxSseServerTransport(objectMapper, "/mcp/message");
var server = McpServer.sync(transport)
    .serverInfo("my-server", "1.0.0")
    .build();

// After
McpServerTransportProvider transportProvider = new WebFluxSseServerTransportProvider(objectMapper, "/mcp/message");
var server = McpServer.sync(transportProvider)
    .serverInfo("my-server", "1.0.0")
    .build();
----

==== Handler Signature Changes

All handlers now receive an `exchange` parameter as their first argument:

[source,java]
----
// Before
.tool(calculatorTool, args -> new CallToolResult("Result: " + calculate(args)))

// After
.tool(calculatorTool, (exchange, args) -> new CallToolResult("Result: " + calculate(args)))
----

==== Client Interaction via Exchange

Methods previously available on the server are now accessed through the exchange object:

[source,java]
----
// Before
ClientCapabilities capabilities = server.getClientCapabilities();
CreateMessageResult result = server.createMessage(new CreateMessageRequest(...));

// After
ClientCapabilities capabilities = exchange.getClientCapabilities();
CreateMessageResult result = exchange.createMessage(new CreateMessageRequest(...));
----

==== Roots Change Handlers

[source,java]
----
// Before
.rootsChangeConsumers(List.of(
    roots -> System.out.println("Roots changed: " + roots)
))

// After
.rootsChangeHandlers(List.of(
    (exchange, roots) -> System.out.println("Roots changed: " + roots)
))
----

For a complete guide to migrating MCP code, refer to the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/pages/mcp-migration.adoc[MCP Migration Guide].

=== Automating upgrading using AI

You can automate the upgrade process to 1.0.0-M7 using the Claude Code CLI tool with a provided prompt:

1. Download the https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview[Claude Code CLI tool]
2. Copy the prompt from the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/src/prompts/update-to-m7.txt[update-to-m7.txt] file
3. Paste the prompt into the Claude Code CLI
4. The AI will analyze your project and make the necessary changes

NOTE: The automated upgrade prompt currently handles artifact ID changes, package relocations, and module structure changes, but does not yet include automatic changes for upgrading to MCP 0.9.0. If you're using MCP, you'll need to manually update your code following the guidance in the xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#mcp-java-sdk-upgrade-to-0-9-0[MCP Java SDK Upgrade] section.

[[common-sections]]
== Common Changes Across Versions

[[common-artifact-id-changes]]
=== Artifact ID Changes

The naming pattern for Spring AI starter artifacts has changed.
You'll need to update your dependencies according to the following patterns:

* Model starters: `spring-ai-\{model\}-spring-boot-starter` → `spring-ai-starter-model-\{model\}`
* Vector Store starters: `spring-ai-\{store\}-store-spring-boot-starter` → `spring-ai-starter-vector-store-\{store\}`
* MCP starters: `spring-ai-mcp-\{type\}-spring-boot-starter` → `spring-ai-starter-mcp-\{type\}`

==== Examples

==== Changes to Spring AI Autoconfiguration Artifacts

The Spring AI autoconfiguration has changed from a single monolithic artifact to individual autoconfiguration artifacts per model, vector store, and other components.
This change was made to minimize the impact of different versions of dependent libraries conflicting, such as Google Protocol Buffers, Google RPC, and others.
By separating autoconfiguration into component-specific artifacts, you can avoid pulling in unnecessary dependencies and reduce the risk of version conflicts in your application.

The original monolithic artifact is no longer available:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<!-- NO LONGER AVAILABLE -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-spring-boot-autoconfigure</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Instead, each component now has its own autoconfiguration artifact following these patterns:

* Model autoconfiguration: `spring-ai-autoconfigure-model-\{model\}`
* Vector Store autoconfiguration: `spring-ai-autoconfigure-vector-store-\{store\}`
* MCP autoconfiguration: `spring-ai-autoconfigure-mcp-\{type\}`

[[common-package-changes]]
=== Package Name Changes

Your IDE should assist with refactoring to the new package locations.

* `KeywordMetadataEnricher` and `SummaryMetadataEnricher` have moved from `org.springframework.ai.transformer` to `org.springframework.ai.chat.transformer`.
* `Content`, `MediaContent`, and `Media` have moved from `org.springframework.ai.model` to `org.springframework.ai.content`.

[[common-module-structure]]
=== Module Structure

The project has undergone significant changes to its module and artifact structure. Previously, `spring-ai-core` contained all central interfaces, but this has now been split into specialized domain modules to reduce unnecessary dependencies in your applications.

image::spring-ai-dependencies.png[Spring AI Dependencies, width=1000, align="center"]

==== spring-ai-commons

Base module with no dependencies on other Spring AI modules. Contains:
- Core domain models (`Document`, `TextSplitter`)
- JSON utilities and resource handling
- Structured logging and observability support

==== spring-ai-model

Provides AI capability abstractions:
- Interfaces like `ChatModel`, `EmbeddingModel`, and `ImageModel`
- Message types and prompt templates
- Function-calling framework (`ToolDefinition`, `ToolCallback`)
- Content filtering and observation support

==== spring-ai-vector-store

Unified vector database abstraction:
- `VectorStore` interface for similarity search
- Advanced filtering with SQL-like expressions
- `SimpleVectorStore` for in-memory usage
- Batching support for embeddings

==== spring-ai-client-chat

High-level conversational AI APIs:
- `ChatClient` interface
- Conversation persistence via `ChatMemory`
- Response conversion with `OutputConverter`
- Advisor-based interception
- Synchronous and reactive streaming support

==== spring-ai-advisors-vector-store

Bridges chat with vector stores for RAG:
- `QuestionAnswerAdvisor`: injects context into prompts
- `VectorStoreChatMemoryAdvisor`: stores/retrieves conversation history

==== spring-ai-model-chat-memory-cassandra

Apache Cassandra persistence for `ChatMemory`:
- `CassandraChatMemory` implementation
- Type-safe CQL with Cassandra's QueryBuilder
==== spring-ai-model-chat-memory-neo4j

Neo4j graph database persistence for chat conversations.

==== spring-ai-rag

Comprehensive framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation:
- Modular architecture for RAG pipelines
- `RetrievalAugmentationAdvisor` as main entry point
- Functional programming principles with composable components

=== Dependency Structure

The dependency hierarchy can be summarized as:

* `spring-ai-commons` (foundation)
* `spring-ai-model` (depends on commons)
* `spring-ai-vector-store` and `spring-ai-client-chat` (both depend on model)
* `spring-ai-advisors-vector-store` and `spring-ai-rag` (depend on both client-chat and vector-store)
* `spring-ai-model-chat-memory-*` modules (depend on client-chat)

[[common-toolcontext-changes]]
=== ToolContext Changes

The `ToolContext` class has been enhanced to support both explicit and implicit tool resolution. Tools can now be:

1. **Explicitly Included**: Tools that are explicitly requested in the prompt and included in the call to the model.
2. **Implicitly Available**: Tools that are made available for runtime dynamic resolution, but never included in any call to the model unless explicitly requested.

Starting with 1.0.0-M7, tools are only included in the call to the model if they are explicitly requested in the prompt or explicitly included in the call.

Additionally, the `ToolContext` class has now been marked as final and cannot be extended anymore. It was never supposed to be subclassed. You can add all the contextual data you need when instantiating a `ToolContext`, in the form of a `Map<String, Object>`. For more information, check the [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/tools.html#_tool_context).

[[upgrading-to-1-0-0-m6]]
== Upgrading to 1.0.0-M6

=== Changes to Usage Interface and DefaultUsage Implementation

The `Usage` interface and its default implementation `DefaultUsage` have undergone the following changes:

1. Method Rename:
* `getGenerationTokens()` is now `getCompletionTokens()`

2. Type Changes:
* All token count fields in `DefaultUsage` changed from `Long` to `Integer`:
** `promptTokens`
** `completionTokens` (formerly `generationTokens`)
** `totalTokens`

==== Required Actions

* Replace all calls to `getGenerationTokens()` with `getCompletionTokens()`

* Update `DefaultUsage` constructor calls:
[source,java]
----
// Old (M5)
new DefaultUsage(Long promptTokens, Long generationTokens, Long totalTokens)

// New (M6)
new DefaultUsage(Integer promptTokens, Integer completionTokens, Integer totalTokens)
----


NOTE: For more information on handling Usage, refer xref:api/usage-handling.adoc[here]

==== JSON Ser/Deser changes
While M6 maintains backward compatibility for JSON deserialization of the `generationTokens` field, this field will be removed in M7. Any persisted JSON documents using the old field name should be updated to use `completionTokens`.

Example of the new JSON format:
[source,json]
----
{
  "promptTokens": 100,
  "completionTokens": 50,
  "totalTokens": 150
}
----

=== Changes to usage of FunctionCallingOptions for tool calling

Each `ChatModel` instance, at construction time, accepts an optional `ChatOptions` or `FunctionCallingOptions` instance
that can be used to configure default tools used for calling the model.

Before 1.0.0-M6:

- any tool passed via the `functions()` method of the default `FunctionCallingOptions` instance was included in
each call to the model from that `ChatModel` instance, possibly overwritten by runtime options.
- any tool passed via the `functionCallbacks()` method of the default `FunctionCallingOptions` instance was only
made available for runtime dynamic resolution (see xref:api/tools.adoc#_tool_resolution[Tool Resolution]), but never
included in any call to the model unless explicitly requested.

Starting 1.0.0-M6:

- any tool passed via the `functions()` method or the `functionCallbacks()` of the default `FunctionCallingOptions`
instance is now handled in the same way: it is included in each call to the model from that `ChatModel` instance,
possibly overwritten by runtime options. With that, there is consistency in the way tools are included in calls
to the model and prevents any confusion due to a difference in behavior between `functionCallbacks()` and all the other options.

If you want to make a tool available for runtime dynamic resolution and include it in a chat request to the model only
when explicitly requested, you can use one of the strategies described in xref:api/tools.adoc#_tool_resolution[Tool Resolution].

NOTE: 1.0.0-M6 introduced new APIs for handling tool calling. Backward compatibility is maintained for the old APIs across
all scenarios, except the one described above. The old APIs are still available, but they are deprecated
and will be removed in 1.0.0-M7.

=== Removal of deprecated Amazon Bedrock chat models

Starting 1.0.0-M6, Spring AI transitioned to using Amazon Bedrock's Converse API for all Chat conversation implementations in Spring AI.
All the Amazon Bedrock Chat models are removed except the Embedding models for Cohere and Titan.

NOTE: Refer to xref:api/chat/bedrock-converse.adoc[Bedrock Converse] documentation for using the chat models.

=== Changes to use Spring Boot 3.4.2 for dependency management

Spring AI updates to use Spring Boot 3.4.2 for the dependency management. You can refer https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v3.4.2/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/build.gradle[here] for the dependencies which Spring Boot 3.4.2

==== Required Actions

* If you are upgrading to Spring Boot 3.4.2, please make sure to refer to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.4-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-33[this] documentation for the changes required to configure the REST Client. Notably, if you don’t have an HTTP client library on the classpath, this will likely result in the use of `JdkClientHttpRequestFactory` where `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` would have been used previously. To switch to use `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory`, you need to set `spring.http.client.factory=simple`.
* If you are using a different version of Spring Boot (say Spring Boot 3.3.x) and need a specific version of a dependency, you can override it in your build configuration.

=== Vector Store API changes

In version 1.0.0-M6, the `delete` method in the `VectorStore` interface has been modified to be a void operation instead of returning an `Optional<Boolean>`.
If your code previously checked the return value of the delete operation, you'll need to remove this check.
The operation now throws an exception if the deletion fails, providing more direct error handling.

==== Before 1.0.0-M6:
[source,java]
----
Optional<Boolean> result = vectorStore.delete(ids);
if (result.isPresent() && result.get()) {
    // handle successful deletion
}
----

==== In 1.0.0-M6 and later:
[source,java]
----
vectorStore.delete(ids);
// deletion successful if no exception is thrown
----

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M5

* Vector Builders have been refactored for consistency.
* Current VectorStore implementation constructors have been deprecated, use the builder pattern.
* VectorStore implementation packages have been moved into unique package names, avoiding conflicts across artifact.  For example `org.springframework.ai.vectorstore` to `org.springframework.ai.pgvector.vectorstore`.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.RC3

* The type of the portable chat options (`frequencyPenalty`, `presencePenalty`, `temperature`, `topP`) has been changed from `Float` to `Double`.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M2

* The configuration prefix for the Chroma Vector Store has been changes from `spring.ai.vectorstore.chroma.store` to `spring.ai.vectorstore.chroma` in order to align with the naming conventions of other vector stores.

* The default value of the `initialize-schema` property on vector stores capable of initializing a schema is now set to `false`.
This implies that the applications now need to explicitly opt-in for schema initialization on supported vector stores, if the schema is expected to be created at application startup.
Not all vector stores support this property.
See the corresponding vector store documentation for more details.
The following are the vector stores that currently don't support the `initialize-schema` property.

1. Hana
2. Pinecone
3. Weaviate

* In Bedrock Jurassic 2, the chat options `countPenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, and `presencePenalty`
have been renamed to `countPenaltyOptions`, `frequencyPenaltyOptions`, and `presencePenaltyOptions`.
Furthermore, the type of the chat option `stopSequences` have been changed from `String[]` to `List<String>`.

* In Azure OpenAI, the type of the chat options `frequencyPenalty` and `presencePenalty`
has been changed from `Double` to `Float`, consistently with all the other implementations.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M1

On our march to release 1.0.0 M1 we have made several breaking changes.  Apologies, it is for the best!

=== ChatClient changes

A major change was made that took the 'old' `ChatClient` and moved the functionality into `ChatModel`.  The 'new' `ChatClient` now takes an instance of `ChatModel`. This was done do support a fluent API for creating and executing prompts in a style similar to other client classes in the Spring ecosystem, such as `RestClient`, `WebClient`, and `JdbcClient`.  Refer to the [JavaDoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/docs/api) for more information on the Fluent API, proper reference documentation is coming shortly.

We renamed the 'old' `ModelClient` to `Model` and renamed implementing classes, for example `ImageClient` was renamed to `ImageModel`.  The `Model` implementation represent the portability layer that converts between the Spring AI API and the underlying AI Model API.

### Adapting to the changes

NOTE: The `ChatClient` class is now in the package `org.springframework.ai.chat.client`

#### Approach 1

Now, instead of getting an Autoconfigured `ChatClient` instance, you will get a `ChatModel` instance.  The `call` method signatures after renaming remain the same.
To adapt your code should refactor you code to change use of the type `ChatClient` to `ChatModel`
Here is an example of existing code before the change

```java
@RestController
public class OldSimpleAiController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    public OldSimpleAiController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", this.chatClient.call(message));
    }
}
```

Now after the changes this will be

```java
@RestController
public class SimpleAiController {

    private final ChatModel chatModel;

    public SimpleAiController(ChatModel chatModel) {
        this.chatModel = chatModel;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", this.chatModel.call(message));
    }
}
```

NOTE: The renaming also applies to the classes
* `StreamingChatClient` -> `StreamingChatModel`
* `EmbeddingClient` -> `EmbeddingModel`
* `ImageClient` -> `ImageModel`
* `SpeechClient` -> `SpeechModel`
* and similar for other `<XYZ>Client` classes

#### Approach 2

In this approach you will use the new fluent API available on the 'new' `ChatClient`

Here is an example of existing code before the change

```java
@RestController
class OldSimpleAiController {

    ChatClient chatClient;

    OldSimpleAiController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
	}

	@GetMapping("/ai/simple")
	Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
		return Map.of(
                "generation",
				this.chatClient.call(message)
        );
	}
}
```

Now after the changes this will be

```java
@RestController
class SimpleAiController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    SimpleAiController(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
      this.chatClient = builder.build();
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of(
                "generation",
				this.chatClient.prompt().user(message).call().content()
        );
    }
}
```


NOTE: The `ChatModel` instance is made available to you through autoconfiguration.

#### Approach 3

There is a tag in the GitHub repository called [v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/tree/v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes) that you can checkout and do a local build to avoid updating any of your code until you are ready to migrate your code base.

```bash
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes

./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```


=== Artifact name changes

Renamed POM artifact names:
- spring-ai-qdrant -> spring-ai-qdrant-store
- spring-ai-cassandra -> spring-ai-cassandra-store
- spring-ai-pinecone -> spring-ai-pinecone-store
- spring-ai-redis -> spring-ai-redis-store
- spring-ai-qdrant -> spring-ai-qdrant-store
- spring-ai-gemfire -> spring-ai-gemfire-store
- spring-ai-azure-vector-store-spring-boot-starter -> spring-ai-azure-store-spring-boot-starter
- spring-ai-redis-spring-boot-starter -> spring-ai-starter-vector-store-redis

== Upgrading to 0.8.1

Former `spring-ai-vertex-ai` has been renamed to `spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2` and `spring-ai-vertex-ai-spring-boot-starter` has been renamed to `spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2-spring-boot-starter`.

So, you need to change the dependency from

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

and the related Boot starter for the Palm2 model has changed from

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

to

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* Renamed Classes (01.03.2024)

** VertexAiApi -> VertexAiPalm2Api
** VertexAiClientChat -> VertexAiPalm2ChatClient
** VertexAiEmbeddingClient -> VertexAiPalm2EmbeddingClient
** VertexAiChatOptions -> VertexAiPalm2ChatOptions

== Upgrading to 0.8.0

=== January 24, 2024 Update

* Moving the `prompt` and `messages` and `metadata` packages to subpackages of `org.sf.ai.chat`
* New functionality is *text to image* clients. Classes are `OpenAiImageModel` and `StabilityAiImageModel`. See the integration tests for usage, docs are coming soon.
* A new package `model` that contains interfaces and base classes to support creating AI Model Clients for any input/output data type combination. At the moment the chat and image model packages implement this. We will be updating the embedding package to this new model soon.
* A new "portable options" design pattern. We wanted to provide as much portability in the `ModelCall` as possible across different chat based AI Models. There is a common set of generation options and then those that are specific to a model provider. A sort of "duck typing" approach is used. `ModelOptions` in the model package is a marker interface indicating implementations of this class will provide the options for a model. See `ImageOptions`, a subinterface that defines portable options across all text->image `ImageModel` implementations.
