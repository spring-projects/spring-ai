[[upgrading-to-1-0-0-snapshot]]
== Upgrading to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

== Part 1
You can upgrade to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT either by following the manual steps outlined below or by using an automated approach with the Claude Code CLI tool and a provided prompt. 

The automated approach can save time and reduce errors when upgrading multiple projects or complex codebases. 
For details on the automated approach, see the xref:upgrade-notes.adoc#automating-upgrading-using-ai[Automating upgrading using AI] section.

=== Manual Upgrade

==== Add Snapshot Repositories

To use the 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version, you need to add the snapshot repositories to your build file. 
For detailed instructions, refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#snapshots-add-snapshot-repositories[Snapshots - Add Snapshot Repositories] section in the Getting Started guide.

==== Update Dependency Management

Update your Spring AI BOM version to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` in your build configuration. 
For detailed instructions on configuring dependency management, refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#dependency-management[Dependency Management] section in the Getting Started guide.

==== Changes to Spring AI Artifact IDs

The naming pattern for Spring AI starter artifacts has changed in 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT. 
You'll need to update your dependencies according to the following patterns:

* Model starters: `spring-ai-\{model\}-spring-boot-starter` → `spring-ai-starter-model-\{model\}`
* Vector Store starters: `spring-ai-\{store\}-store-spring-boot-starter` → `spring-ai-starter-vector-store-\{store\}`
* MCP starters: `spring-ai-mcp-\{type\}-spring-boot-starter` → `spring-ai-starter-mcp-\{type\}`

==== Changes to Spring AI Autoconfiguration Artifacts

The Spring AI autoconfiguration has changed from a single monolithic artifact to individual autoconfiguration artifacts per model, vector store, and other components. 
This change was made to minimize the impact of different versions of dependent libraries conflicting, such as Google Protocol Buffers, Google RPC, and others. 
By separating autoconfiguration into component-specific artifacts, you can avoid pulling in unnecessary dependencies and reduce the risk of version conflicts in your application.

The original monolithic artifact is no longer available:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<!-- NO LONGER AVAILABLE -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-spring-boot-autoconfigure</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Instead, each component now has its own autoconfiguration artifact following these patterns:

* Model autoconfiguration: `spring-ai-autoconfigure-model-\{model\}`
* Vector Store autoconfiguration: `spring-ai-autoconfigure-vector-store-\{store\}`
* MCP autoconfiguration: `spring-ai-autoconfigure-mcp-\{type\}`

[[automating-upgrading-using-ai]]
=== Automating upgrading using AI

You can automate the upgrade process to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT using the Claude Code CLI tool with a provided prompt. The prompt will guide the AI to perform the following tasks:

1. Update the Spring AI BOM version to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
2. Ensure all required repositories exist in your build configuration
3. Update Spring AI artifact IDs according to the new naming patterns

To use this automation:

1. Download the https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview[Claude Code CLI tool]
2. Copy the prompt from the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/src/prompts/update-to-snapshot.txt[update-to-snapshot.txt] file
3. Paste the prompt into the Claude Code CLI
4. The AI will analyze your project and make the necessary changes

This approach can save time and reduce the chance of errors when upgrading multiple projects or complex codebases.

== Part 2

As of April 4, the main branch now has changes to module/artifact structure of the project.
Since the start of the Spring AI project, there has been one central artifact where the main interfaces are defined, the `spring-ai-core` module.
Over time, this has grown to contain multiple specialized domains and we wanted to separate these domain out into their own modules.
For example, to use the `ChatClient` functionality, there does not need to be any classes related to Vector Stores in your application.

The `spring-ai-core` module had a clean Dependency Structure Matrix, so most of the work to break up this module was simply cut and pasting code.
However, there were a few cases where the package names of classes have been changed.

=== Changes to package names

Your IDE should assist with refactoring to the new package locations.

`ContentFormatTransformer` and `KeywordMetadataEnricher` have moved from `org.springframework.ai.transformer` to `org.springframework.ai.chat.transformer`.

`Content`, `MediaContent`, and `Media` have moved from `org.springframework.ai.model` to `org.springframework.ai.content`.


=== New Modules Overview

image::spring-ai-dependencies.png[Spring AI Dependnecies, width=1000, align="center"]

==== `spring-ai-commons`

This is a base module with no dependencies on other Spring AI modules.
It defines core domain models (`Document`, `TextSplitter`, etc.), JSON utilities, resource handling, and structured logging.
Supports document processing, tokenization, embedding optimization, and observability via operation metadata and metrics.

==== `spring-ai-model`

Provides abstractions for AI capabilities via interfaces like `ChatModel`, `EmbeddingModel`, and `ImageModel`.
Includes message types, prompt templates, response structures, and a full function-calling framework (`ToolDefinition`, `ToolCallback`, annotations).
Supports observation, content filtering, and consistent builder/strategy patterns across AI providers.

==== `spring-ai-vector-store`

Defines a unified abstraction (`VectorStore`) for vector databases and similarity search.
Includes advanced filtering via SQL-like expressions, `SearchRequest`, and `Filter.Expression.`
Offers `SimpleVectorStore` (in-memory) and observability integration.
Emphasizes type safety, extensibility, and batching support for embeddings.

==== `spring-ai-client-chat`

This module provides high-level APIs for conversational AI via the `ChatClient` interface.
Includes conversation persistence (`ChatMemory`), response conversion (`OutputConverter`), and advisor-based interception.
Supports synchronous and streaming (Project Reactor) interactions with observability via Micrometer.

This client layer abstracts away the complexities of different AI model implementations, providing application developers with a uniform way to incorporate conversational AI capabilities while handling common concerns like conversation state management, response transformation, and instrumentation in a consistent manner.

==== `spring-ai-advisors-vector-store`

Bridges chat with vector stores for RAG and persistent memory.

`QuestionAnswerAdvisor`: injects context into prompts using similarity search.

`VectorStoreChatMemoryAdvisor`: stores/retrieves conversation history in vector stores, with filtering and session continuity.

This component is essential for implementing sophisticated conversational applications that require both context retrieval and memory persistence within the Spring AI ecosystem.

==== `spring-ai-model-chat-memory-cassandra`

This module adds Apache Cassandra persistence for `ChatMemory` (via `CassandraChatMemory`).
Extracted from the Cassandra vector store module to provide a standalone, production-ready solution.
Uses immutable config records and Cassandra's QueryBuilder for type-safe CQL.

==== `spring-ai-model-chat-memory-neo4j`

This module provides Neo4j graph database persistence for chat conversations.
This functionality was previously located in the Neo4j vector store implementation module, but has been extracted to create a dedicated chat memory solution.

==== `spring-ai-rag`

This module provides a comprehensive framework for implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines based on a modular architecture inspired by academic research. It offers a structured approach to the entire RAG workflow through well-defined interfaces for each stage of the process.

The central `RetrievalAugmentationAdvisor` serves as the main entry point, orchestrating the entire RAG workflow.
The design follows functional programming principles with composable components, enabling customization of each pipeline stage while maintaining a consistent programming model aligned with Spring's conventions.

=== Dependency Structure

The dependency hierarchy can be summarized as:

* `spring-ai-commons` (foundation)
* `spring-ai-model` (depends on commons)
* `spring-ai-vector-store` and `spring-ai-client-chat` (both depend on model)
* `spring-ai-advisors-vector-store` and `spring-ai-rag` (depend on both client-chat and vector-store)
* `spring-ai-model-chat-memory-*` modules (depend on client-chat)

The details are:

=== ToolContext changes

* The `ToolContext` class has now been marked as final and cannot be extended anymore. It was never supposed to be subclassed. You can add all the contextual data you need when instantiating a `ToolContext`, in the form of a `Map<String, Object>`. For more information, check the [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/tools.html#_tool_context).

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M6

=== Changes to Usage Interface and DefaultUsage Implementation

The `Usage` interface and its default implementation `DefaultUsage` have undergone the following changes:

1. Method Rename:
* `getGenerationTokens()` is now `getCompletionTokens()`

2. Type Changes:
* All token count fields in `DefaultUsage` changed from `Long` to `Integer`:
** `promptTokens`
** `completionTokens` (formerly `generationTokens`)
** `totalTokens`

==== Required Actions

* Replace all calls to `getGenerationTokens()` with `getCompletionTokens()`

* Update `DefaultUsage` constructor calls:
[source,java]
----
// Old (M5)
new DefaultUsage(Long promptTokens, Long generationTokens, Long totalTokens)

// New (M6)
new DefaultUsage(Integer promptTokens, Integer completionTokens, Integer totalTokens)
----


NOTE: For more information on handling Usage, refer xref:api/usage-handling.adoc[here]

==== JSON Ser/Deser changes
While M6 maintains backward compatibility for JSON deserialization of the `generationTokens` field, this field will be removed in M7. Any persisted JSON documents using the old field name should be updated to use `completionTokens`.

Example of the new JSON format:
[source,json]
----
{
  "promptTokens": 100,
  "completionTokens": 50,
  "totalTokens": 150
}
----

=== Changes to usage of FunctionCallingOptions for tool calling

Each `ChatModel` instance, at construction time, accepts an optional `ChatOptions` or `FunctionCallingOptions` instance
that can be used to configure default tools used for calling the model.

Before 1.0.0-M6:

- any tool passed via the `functions()` method of the default `FunctionCallingOptions` instance was included in
each call to the model from that `ChatModel` instance, possibly overwritten by runtime options.
- any tool passed via the `functionCallbacks()` method of the default `FunctionCallingOptions` instance was only
made available for runtime dynamic resolution (see xref:api/tools.adoc#_tool_resolution[Tool Resolution]), but never
included in any call to the model unless explicitly requested.

Starting 1.0.0-M6:

- any tool passed via the `functions()` method or the `functionCallbacks()` of the default `FunctionCallingOptions`
instance is now handled in the same way: it is included in each call to the model from that `ChatModel` instance,
possibly overwritten by runtime options. With that, there is consistency in the way tools are included in calls
to the model and prevents any confusion due to a difference in behavior between `functionCallbacks()` and all the other options.

If you want to make a tool available for runtime dynamic resolution and include it in a chat request to the model only
when explicitly requested, you can use one of the strategies described in xref:api/tools.adoc#_tool_resolution[Tool Resolution].

NOTE: 1.0.0-M6 introduced new APIs for handling tool calling. Backward compatibility is maintained for the old APIs across
all scenarios, except the one described above. The old APIs are still available, but they are deprecated
and will be removed in 1.0.0-M7.

=== Removal of deprecated Amazon Bedrock chat models

Starting 1.0.0-M6, Spring AI transitioned to using Amazon Bedrock's Converse API for all Chat conversation implementations in Spring AI.
All the Amazon Bedrock Chat models are removed except the Embedding models for Cohere and Titan.

NOTE: Refer to xref:api/chat/bedrock-converse.adoc[Bedrock Converse] documentation for using the chat models.

=== Changes to use Spring Boot 3.4.2 for dependency management

Spring AI updates to use Spring Boot 3.4.2 for the dependency management. You can refer https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v3.4.2/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/build.gradle[here] for the dependencies which Spring Boot 3.4.2

==== Required Actions

* If you are upgrading to Spring Boot 3.4.2, please make sure to refer to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.4-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-33[this] documentation for the changes required to configure the REST Client. Notably, if you don’t have an HTTP client library on the classpath, this will likely result in the use of `JdkClientHttpRequestFactory` where `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` would have been used previously. To switch to use `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory`, you need to set `spring.http.client.factory=simple`.
* If you are using a different version of Spring Boot (say Spring Boot 3.3.x) and need a specific version of a dependency, you can override it in your build configuration.

=== Vector Store API changes

In version 1.0.0-M6, the `delete` method in the `VectorStore` interface has been modified to be a void operation instead of returning an `Optional<Boolean>`.
If your code previously checked the return value of the delete operation, you'll need to remove this check.
The operation now throws an exception if the deletion fails, providing more direct error handling.

==== Before 1.0.0-M6:
[source,java]
----
Optional<Boolean> result = vectorStore.delete(ids);
if (result.isPresent() && result.get()) {
    // handle successful deletion
}
----

==== In 1.0.0-M6 and later:
[source,java]
----
vectorStore.delete(ids);
// deletion successful if no exception is thrown
----

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M5

* Vector Builders have been refactored for consistency.
* Current VectorStore implementation constructors have been deprecated, use the builder pattern.
* VectorStore implementation packages have been moved into unique package names, avoiding conflicts across artifact.  For example `org.springframework.ai.vectorstore` to `org.springframework.ai.pgvector.vectorstore`.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.RC3

* The type of the portable chat options (`frequencyPenalty`, `presencePenalty`, `temperature`, `topP`) has been changed from `Float` to `Double`.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M2

* The configuration prefix for the Chroma Vector Store has been changes from `spring.ai.vectorstore.chroma.store` to `spring.ai.vectorstore.chroma` in order to align with the naming conventions of other vector stores.

* The default value of the `initialize-schema` property on vector stores capable of initializing a schema is now set to `false`.
This implies that the applications now need to explicitly opt-in for schema initialization on supported vector stores, if the schema is expected to be created at application startup.
Not all vector stores support this property.
See the corresponding vector store documentation for more details.
The following are the vector stores that currently don't support the `initialize-schema` property.

1. Hana
2. Pinecone
3. Weaviate

* In Bedrock Jurassic 2, the chat options `countPenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, and `presencePenalty`
have been renamed to `countPenaltyOptions`, `frequencyPenaltyOptions`, and `presencePenaltyOptions`.
Furthermore, the type of the chat option `stopSequences` have been changed from `String[]` to `List<String>`.

* In Azure OpenAI, the type of the chat options `frequencyPenalty` and `presencePenalty`
has been changed from `Double` to `Float`, consistently with all the other implementations.

== Upgrading to 1.0.0.M1

On our march to release 1.0.0 M1 we have made several breaking changes.  Apologies, it is for the best!

=== ChatClient changes

A major change was made that took the 'old' `ChatClient` and moved the functionality into `ChatModel`.  The 'new' `ChatClient` now takes an instance of `ChatModel`. This was done do support a fluent API for creating and executing prompts in a style similar to other client classes in the Spring ecosystem, such as `RestClient`, `WebClient`, and `JdbcClient`.  Refer to the [JavaDoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/docs/api) for more information on the Fluent API, proper reference documentation is coming shortly.

We renamed the 'old' `ModelClient` to `Model` and renamed implementing classes, for example `ImageClient` was renamed to `ImageModel`.  The `Model` implementation represent the portability layer that converts between the Spring AI API and the underlying AI Model API.

### Adapting to the changes

NOTE: The `ChatClient` class is now in the package `org.springframework.ai.chat.client`

#### Approach 1

Now, instead of getting an Autoconfigured `ChatClient` instance, you will get a `ChatModel` instance.  The `call` method signatures after renaming remain the same.
To adapt your code should refactor you code to change use of the type `ChatClient` to `ChatModel`
Here is an example of existing code before the change

```java
@RestController
public class OldSimpleAiController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    public OldSimpleAiController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", this.chatClient.call(message));
    }
}
```

Now after the changes this will be

```java
@RestController
public class SimpleAiController {

    private final ChatModel chatModel;

    public SimpleAiController(ChatModel chatModel) {
        this.chatModel = chatModel;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", this.chatModel.call(message));
    }
}
```

NOTE: The renaming also applies to the classes
* `StreamingChatClient` -> `StreamingChatModel`
* `EmbeddingClient` -> `EmbeddingModel`
* `ImageClient` -> `ImageModel`
* `SpeechClient` -> `SpeechModel`
* and similar for other `<XYZ>Client` classes

#### Approach 2

In this approach you will use the new fluent API available on the 'new' `ChatClient`

Here is an example of existing code before the change

```java
@RestController
class OldSimpleAiController {

    ChatClient chatClient;

    OldSimpleAiController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
	}

	@GetMapping("/ai/simple")
	Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
		return Map.of(
                "generation",
				this.chatClient.call(message)
        );
	}
}
```

Now after the changes this will be

```java
@RestController
class SimpleAiController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    SimpleAiController(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
      this.chatClient = builder.build();
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/simple")
    Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of(
                "generation",
				this.chatClient.prompt().user(message).call().content()
        );
    }
}
```


NOTE: The `ChatModel` instance is made available to you through autoconfiguration.

#### Approach 3

There is a tag in the GitHub repository called [v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/tree/v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes) that you can checkout and do a local build to avoid updating any of your code until you are ready to migrate your code base.

```bash
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-before-chatclient-changes

./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```


=== Artifact name changes

Renamed POM artifact names:
- spring-ai-qdrant -> spring-ai-qdrant-store
- spring-ai-cassandra -> spring-ai-cassandra-store
- spring-ai-pinecone -> spring-ai-pinecone-store
- spring-ai-redis -> spring-ai-redis-store
- spring-ai-qdrant -> spring-ai-qdrant-store
- spring-ai-gemfire -> spring-ai-gemfire-store
- spring-ai-azure-vector-store-spring-boot-starter -> spring-ai-azure-store-spring-boot-starter
- spring-ai-redis-spring-boot-starter -> spring-ai-starter-vector-store-redis

== Upgrading to 0.8.1

Former `spring-ai-vertex-ai` has been renamed to `spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2` and `spring-ai-vertex-ai-spring-boot-starter` has been renamed to `spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2-spring-boot-starter`.

So, you need to change the dependency from

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

and the related Boot starter for the Palm2 model has changed from

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

to

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-vertex-ai-palm2-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* Renamed Classes (01.03.2024)

** VertexAiApi -> VertexAiPalm2Api
** VertexAiClientChat -> VertexAiPalm2ChatClient
** VertexAiEmbeddingClient -> VertexAiPalm2EmbeddingClient
** VertexAiChatOptions -> VertexAiPalm2ChatOptions

== Upgrading to 0.8.0

=== January 24, 2024 Update

* Moving the `prompt` and `messages` and `metadata` packages to subpackages of `org.sf.ai.chat`
* New functionality is *text to image* clients. Classes are `OpenAiImageModel` and `StabilityAiImageModel`. See the integration tests for usage, docs are coming soon.
* A new package `model` that contains interfaces and base classes to support creating AI Model Clients for any input/output data type combination. At the moment the chat and image model packages implement this. We will be updating the embedding package to this new model soon.
* A new "portable options" design pattern. We wanted to provide as much portability in the `ModelCall` as possible across different chat based AI Models. There is a common set of generation options and then those that are specific to a model provider. A sort of "duck typing" approach is used. `ModelOptions` in the model package is a marker interface indicating implementations of this class will provide the options for a model. See `ImageOptions`, a subinterface that defines portable options across all text->image `ImageModel` implementations. Then `StabilityAiImageOptions` and `OpenAiImageOptions` provide the options specific to each model provider. All options classes are created via a fluent API builder all can be passed into the portable `ImageModel` API. These option data types are using in autoconfiguration/configuration properties for the `ImageModel` implementations.

=== January 13, 2024 Update

The following OpenAi Autoconfiguration chat properties has changed

* from `spring.ai.openai.model` to `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.model`.
* from `spring.ai.openai.temperature` to `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.temperature`.

Find updated documentation about the OpenAi properties: https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chat/openai-chat.html

=== December 27, 2023 Update

Merge SimplePersistentVectorStore and InMemoryVectorStore into SimpleVectorStore
* Replace InMemoryVectorStore with SimpleVectorStore

=== December 20, 2023 Update

Refactor the Ollama client and related classes and package names

* Replace the org.springframework.ai.ollama.client.OllamaClient by org.springframework.ai.ollama.OllamaModelCall.
* The OllamaChatClient method signatures have changed.
* Rename the org.springframework.ai.autoconfigure.ollama.OllamaProperties into org.springframework.ai.model.ollama.autoconfigure.OllamaChatProperties and change the suffix to: `spring.ai.ollama.chat`. Some of the properties have changed as well.

=== December 19, 2023 Update

Renaming of AiClient and related classes and package names

* Rename AiClient to ChatClient
* Rename AiResponse to ChatResponse
* Rename AiStreamClient to StreamingChatClient
* Rename package org.sf.ai.client to org.sf.ai.chat
