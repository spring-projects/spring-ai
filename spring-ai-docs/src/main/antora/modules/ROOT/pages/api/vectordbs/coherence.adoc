== Accessing the Native Client

The Coherence Vector Store implementation provides access to the underlying native Coherence client (`Session`) through the `getNativeClient()` method:

[source,java]
----
CoherenceVectorStore vectorStore = context.getBean(CoherenceVectorStore.class);
Optional<Session> nativeClient = vectorStore.getNativeClient();

if (nativeClient.isPresent()) {
    Session session = nativeClient.get();
    // Use the native client for Coherence-specific operations
}
----

The native client gives you access to Coherence-specific features and operations that might not be exposed through the `VectorStore` interface.
