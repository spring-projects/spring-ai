= Ollama Chat

With https://ollama.ai/[Ollama] you can run various Large Language Models (LLMs) locally and generate text from them.
Spring AI supports the Ollama chat completion capabilities with the `OllamaChatModel` API.

TIP: Ollama offers an OpenAI API compatible endpoint as well. 
The xref:_openai_api_compatibility[OpenAI API compatibility] section explains how to use the xref:api/chat/openai-chat.adoc[Spring AI OpenAI] to connect to an Ollama server.

== Prerequisites

You first need to xref:https://ollama.com/download[Download and install Ollama] on your local machine.

Also you can pull the models you want to use from the xref:https://ollama.com/library[Ollama model repository]: `ollama pull <desired model name>`.
Alternatively, you can enable the `pullMissingModel` option to automatically download missing models: xref:auto-pulling-models[Auto-pulling Models].

TIP: you can also pull, by name, any of the thousands, free, xref:https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending[GGUF HuggingFace Models] 

== Auto-configuration

Spring AI provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for the Ollama chat integration.
To enable it add the following dependency to your project's Maven `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-ai-ollama-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

or to your Gradle `build.gradle` build file.

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-ollama-spring-boot-starter'
}
----

TIP: Refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#dependency-management[Dependency Management] section to add the Spring AI BOM to your build file.

=== Chat Properties

The prefix `spring.ai.ollama` is the property prefix to configure the connection to Ollama.

[cols="3,6,1"]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| spring.ai.ollama.base-url | Base URL where Ollama API server is running. | `http://localhost:11434`
|====

The prefix `spring.ai.ollama.chat.options` is the property prefix that configures the Ollama chat model .
It includes the Ollama request (advanced) parameters such as the `model`, `keep-alive`, and `format` as well as the Ollama model `options` properties.

Here are the advanced request parameter for the Ollama chat model:

[cols="3,6,1"]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| spring.ai.ollama.chat.enabled      | Enable Ollama chat model. | true
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.model  | The name of the https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#model-library[supported model] to use. | mistral
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.pull-missing-model | Automatically pull missing models from Ollama repository | false
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.format  | The format to return a response in. Currently, the only accepted value is `json` | -
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.keep_alive  | Controls how long the model will stay loaded into memory following the request | 5m
|====

The remaining `options` properties are based on the link:https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values[Ollama Valid Parameters and Values] and link:https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/api/types.go[Ollama Types]. The default values are based on the link:https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/b538dc3858014f94b099730a592751a5454cab0a/api/types.go#L364[Ollama Types Defaults].

[cols="3,6,1"]
|====
| Property | Description | Default
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.numa              | Whether to use NUMA.                                           | false
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.num-ctx           | Sets the size of the context window used to generate the next token. | 2048
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.num-batch         | Prompt processing maximum batch size. | 512
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.num-gpu           | The number of layers to send to the GPU(s). On macOS it defaults to 1 to enable metal support, 0 to disable. 1 here indicates that NumGPU should be set dynamically | -1
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.main-gpu          | When using multiple GPUs this option controls which GPU is used for small tensors for which the overhead of splitting the computation across all GPUs is not worthwhile. The GPU in question will use slightly more VRAM to store a scratch buffer for temporary results. | 0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.low-vram          | -                                                             | false
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.f16-kv            | -                                                             | true
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.logits-all        | Return logits for all the tokens, not just the last one. To enable completions to return logprobs, this must be true. | -
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.vocab-only        | Load only the vocabulary, not the weights. | -
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.use-mmap          | By default, models are mapped into memory, which allows the system to load only the necessary parts of the model as needed. However, if the model is larger than your total amount of RAM or if your system is low on available memory, using mmap might increase the risk of pageouts, negatively impacting performance. Disabling mmap results in slower load times but may reduce pageouts if you're not using mlock. Note that if the model is larger than the total amount of RAM, turning off mmap would prevent the model from loading at all. | null
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.use-mlock         | Lock the model in memory, preventing it from being swapped out when memory-mapped. This can improve performance but trades away some of the advantages of memory-mapping by requiring more RAM to run and potentially slowing down load times as the model loads into RAM. | false
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.num-thread        | Sets the number of threads to use during computation. By default, Ollama will detect this for optimal performance. It is recommended to set this value to the number of physical CPU cores your system has (as opposed to the logical number of cores). 0 = let the runtime decide | 0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.num-keep          | -                                                             | 4
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.seed              | Sets the random number seed to use for generation. Setting this to a specific number will make the model generate the same text for the same prompt.  | -1
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.num-predict       | Maximum number of tokens to predict when generating text. (-1 = infinite generation, -2 = fill context) | -1
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.top-k             | Reduces the probability of generating nonsense. A higher value (e.g., 100) will give more diverse answers, while a lower value (e.g., 10) will be more conservative.  | 40
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.top-p             | Works together with top-k. A higher value (e.g., 0.95) will lead to more diverse text, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) will generate more focused and conservative text.  | 0.9
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.tfs-z             | Tail-free sampling is used to reduce the impact of less probable tokens from the output. A higher value (e.g., 2.0) will reduce the impact more, while a value of 1.0 disables this setting. | 1.0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.typical-p         | -                                                             | 1.0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.repeat-last-n     | Sets how far back for the model to look back to prevent repetition. (Default: 64, 0 = disabled, -1 = num_ctx) | 64
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.temperature       | The temperature of the model. Increasing the temperature will make the model answer more creatively. | 0.8
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.repeat-penalty    | Sets how strongly to penalize repetitions. A higher value (e.g., 1.5) will penalize repetitions more strongly, while a lower value (e.g., 0.9) will be more lenient. | 1.1
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.presence-penalty  | -                                                             | 0.0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.frequency-penalty | -                                                             | 0.0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.mirostat          | Enable Mirostat sampling for controlling perplexity. (default: 0, 0 = disabled, 1 = Mirostat, 2 = Mirostat 2.0) | 0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.mirostat-tau      | Controls the balance between coherence and diversity of the output. A lower value will result in more focused and coherent text. | 5.0
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.mirostat-eta      | Influences how quickly the algorithm responds to feedback from the generated text. A lower learning rate will result in slower adjustments, while a higher learning rate will make the algorithm more responsive. | 0.1

| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.stop              | Sets the stop sequences to use. When this pattern is encountered the LLM will stop generating text and return. Multiple stop patterns may be set by specifying multiple separate stop parameters in a modelfile. | -
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.functions         | List of functions, identified by their names, to enable for function calling in a single prompt requests. Functions with those names must exist in the functionCallbacks registry. | -
| spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.proxy-tool-calls | If true, the Spring AI will not handle the function calls internally, but will proxy them to the client. Then is the client's responsibility to handle the function calls, dispatch them to the appropriate function, and return the results. If false (the default), the Spring AI will handle the function calls internally. Applicable only for chat models with function calling support | false
|====

TIP: All properties prefixed with `spring.ai.ollama.chat.options` can be overridden at runtime by adding request-specific <<chat-options>> to the `Prompt` call.

== Runtime Options [[chat-options]]

The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-ollama/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/ollama/api/OllamaOptions.java[OllamaOptions.java] class provides model configurations, such as the model to use, the temperature,  etc.

On start-up, the default options can be configured with the `OllamaChatModel(api, options)` constructor or the `spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.*` properties.

At run-time, you can override the default options by adding new, request-specific options to the `Prompt` call.
For example, to override the default model and temperature for a specific request:

[source,java]
----
ChatResponse response = chatModel.call(
    new Prompt(
        "Generate the names of 5 famous pirates.",
        OllamaOptions.builder()
            .withModel(OllamaModel.LLAMA3_1)
            .withTemperature(0.4)
            .build()
    ));
----

TIP: In addition to the model specific link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-ollama/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/ollama/api/OllamaOptions.java[OllamaOptions] you can use a portable https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/prompt/ChatOptions.java[ChatOptions] instance, created with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/prompt/ChatOptionsBuilder.java[ChatOptionsBuilder#builder()].

[[auto-pulling-models]]
=== Auto-pulling Models

The `pullMissingModel` option allows you to automatically download and use models that are not currently available on your local Ollama instance. 
This feature is particularly useful when working with different models or when deploying your application to new environments.

To enable auto-pulling of missing models, you can set the `pullMissingModel` option to `true` in your `OllamaOptions`:

[source,java]
----
OllamaOptions options = OllamaOptions.builder()
    .withModel("all-minilm:latest")
    .withPullMissingModel(true)
    .build();
----

TIP: you can also pull, by name, any of the thousands, free, xref:https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending[GGUF HuggingFace Models] 

You can also configure this option using the following property: `spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.pull-missing-model=true`

When `pullMissingModel` is set to `true`, the system will attempt to download the specified model if it's not already available locally. This process may take some time depending on the size of the model and your internet connection speed.

CAUTION: Be aware that enabling this option may lead to unexpected delays in your application if it needs to download large model files. It's recommended to pre-download commonly used models in production environments.

== Function Calling

You can register custom Java functions with the `OllamaChatModel` and have the Ollama model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call one or many of the registered functions.
This is a powerful technique to connect the LLM capabilities with external tools and APIs.
Read more about xref:api/chat/functions/ollama-chat-functions.adoc[Ollama Function Calling].

TIP: You need Ollama 0.2.8 or newer to use the functional calling capabilities.

NOTE: Currently, the Ollama API (0.3.8) does not support function calling in streaming mode.

== Multimodal

Multimodality refers to a model's ability to simultaneously understand and process information from various sources, including text, images, audio, and other data formats.

Some of the models available in Ollama with multimodality support are https://ollama.com/library/llava[LLaVa] and https://ollama.com/library/bakllava[bakllava] (see the link:https://ollama.com/search?c=vision[full list]).
For further details, refer to the link:https://llava-vl.github.io/[LLaVA: Large Language and Vision Assistant].

The Ollama link:https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#parameters-1[Message API] provides an "images" parameter to incorporate a list of base64-encoded images with the message.

Spring AI’s link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/messages/Message.java[Message] interface facilitates multimodal AI models by introducing the link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/messages/Media.java[Media] type.
This type encompasses data and details regarding media attachments in messages, utilizing Spring’s `org.springframework.util.MimeType` and a `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` for the raw media data.

Below is a straightforward code example excerpted from link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-ollama/src/test/java/org/springframework/ai/ollama/OllamaChatModelMultimodalIT.java[OllamaChatModelMultimodalIT.java], illustrating the fusion of user text with an image.

[source,java]
----
var imageResource = new ClassPathResource("/multimodal.test.png");

var userMessage = new UserMessage("Explain what do you see on this picture?",
        new Media(MimeTypeUtils.IMAGE_PNG, imageResource));

ChatResponse response = chatModel.call(new Prompt(userMessage,
        OllamaOptions.builder().withModel(OllamaModel.LLAVA)).build());
----

The example shows a model taking as an input the `multimodal.test.png` image:

image::multimodal.test.png[Multimodal Test Image, 200, 200, align="left"]

along with the text message "Explain what do you see on this picture?", and generating a response like this:

----
The image shows a small metal basket filled with ripe bananas and red apples. The basket is placed on a surface,
which appears to be a table or countertop, as there's a hint of what seems like a kitchen cabinet or drawer in
the background. There's also a gold-colored ring visible behind the basket, which could indicate that this
photo was taken in an area with metallic decorations or fixtures. The overall setting suggests a home environment
where fruits are being displayed, possibly for convenience or aesthetic purposes.
----

== OpenAI API Compatibility

Ollama is OpenAI API-compatible and you can use the xref:api/chat/openai-chat.adoc[Spring AI OpenAI] client to talk to Ollama and use tools.
For this, you need to configure the OpenAI base URL to your Ollama instance: `spring.ai.openai.chat.base-url=http://localhost:11434` and select one of the provided Ollama models: `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.model=mistral`.

image::spring-ai-ollama-over-openai.jpg[Ollama OpenAI API compatibility, 800, 600, align="center"]

Check the link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-openai/src/test/java/org/springframework/ai/openai/chat/proxy/OllamaWithOpenAiChatModelIT.java[OllamaWithOpenAiChatModelIT.java] tests for examples of using Ollama over Spring AI OpenAI.

== Sample Controller

https://start.spring.io/[Create] a new Spring Boot project and add the `spring-ai-ollama-spring-boot-starter` to your pom (or gradle) dependencies.

Add a `application.properties` file, under the `src/main/resources` directory, to enable and configure the Ollama chat model:

[source,application.properties]
----
spring.ai.ollama.base-url=http://localhost:11434
spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.model=mistral
spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.temperature=0.7
----

TIP: Replace the `base-url` with your Ollama server URL.

This will create an `OllamaChatModel` implementation that you can inject into your classes.
Here is an example of a simple `@RestController` class that uses the chat model for text generations.

[source,java]
----
@RestController
public class ChatController {

    private final OllamaChatModel chatModel;

    @Autowired
    public ChatController(OllamaChatModel chatModel) {
        this.chatModel = chatModel;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/generate")
    public Map<String,String> generate(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", chatModel.call(message));
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/generateStream")
	public Flux<ChatResponse> generateStream(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        Prompt prompt = new Prompt(new UserMessage(message));
        return chatModel.stream(prompt);
    }

}
----

== Manual Configuration

If you don't want to use the Spring Boot auto-configuration, you can manually configure the `OllamaChatModel` in your application.
The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-ollama/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/ollama/OllamaChatModel.java[OllamaChatModel] implements the `ChatModel` and `StreamingChatModel` and uses the <<low-level-api>> to connect to the Ollama service.

To use it, add the `spring-ai-ollama` dependency to your project's Maven `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-ollama</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

or to your Gradle `build.gradle` build file.

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-ollama'
}
----

TIP: Refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#dependency-management[Dependency Management] section to add the Spring AI BOM to your build file.

TIP: The `spring-ai-ollama` dependency provides access also to the `OllamaEmbeddingModel`.
For more information about the `OllamaEmbeddingModel` refer to the link:../embeddings/ollama-embeddings.html[Ollama Embedding Model] section.

Next, create an `OllamaChatModel` instance and use it to send requests for text generation:

[source,java]
----
var ollamaApi = new OllamaApi();

var chatModel = new OllamaChatModel(ollamaApi,
            OllamaOptions.create()
                .withModel(OllamaOptions.DEFAULT_MODEL)
                .withTemperature(0.9));

ChatResponse response = chatModel.call(
    new Prompt("Generate the names of 5 famous pirates."));

// Or with streaming responses
Flux<ChatResponse> response = chatModel.stream(
    new Prompt("Generate the names of 5 famous pirates."));
----

The `OllamaOptions` provides the configuration information for all chat requests.

== Low-level OllamaApi Client [[low-level-api]]

The link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-ollama/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/ollama/api/OllamaApi.java[OllamaApi] provides a lightweight Java client for the Ollama Chat Completion API link:https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-chat-completion[Ollama Chat Completion API].

The following class diagram illustrates the `OllamaApi` chat interfaces and building blocks:

image::ollama-chat-completion-api.jpg[OllamaApi Chat Completion API Diagram, 800, 600]

NOTE: The `OllamaApi` is a low-level API and is not recommended for direct use. Use the `OllamaChatModel` instead.

Here is a simple snippet showing how to use the API programmatically:

[source,java]
----
OllamaApi ollamaApi = new OllamaApi("YOUR_HOST:YOUR_PORT");

// Sync request
var request = ChatRequest.builder("orca-mini")
    .withStream(false) // not streaming
    .withMessages(List.of(
            Message.builder(Role.SYSTEM)
                .withContent("You are a geography teacher. You are talking to a student.")
                .build(),
            Message.builder(Role.USER)
                .withContent("What is the capital of Bulgaria and what is the size? "
                        + "What is the national anthem?")
                .build()))
    .withOptions(OllamaOptions.create().withTemperature(0.9))
    .build();

ChatResponse response = ollamaApi.chat(request);

// Streaming request
var request2 = ChatRequest.builder("orca-mini")
    .withStream(true) // streaming
    .withMessages(List.of(Message.builder(Role.USER)
        .withContent("What is the capital of Bulgaria and what is the size? " + "What is the national anthem?")
        .build()))
    .withOptions(OllamaOptions.create().withTemperature(0.9).toMap())
    .build();

Flux<ChatResponse> streamingResponse = ollamaApi.streamingChat(request2);
----
