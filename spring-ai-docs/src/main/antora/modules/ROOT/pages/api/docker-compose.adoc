= Docker Compose

Spring AI provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for establishing a connection to a model service
or vector store running via Docker Compose. To enable it, add the following dependency
to your project's Maven `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-ai-spring-boot-docker-compose</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

or to your Gradle `build.gradle` build file.

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-spring-boot-docker-compose'
}
----

TIP: Refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#dependency-management[Dependency Management] section to add the Spring AI BOM to your build file.
