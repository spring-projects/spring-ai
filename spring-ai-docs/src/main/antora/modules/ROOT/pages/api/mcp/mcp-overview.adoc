= Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The link:https://modelcontextprotocol.org/docs/concepts/architecture[Model Context Protocol] (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI models to interact with external tools and resources in a structured way. 
It supports multiple transport mechanisms for flexibility in different environments.

The link:https://modelcontextprotocol.github.io/sdk/java[Java MCP] provides a Java SDK implementation of the Model Context Protocol, enabling standardized interaction with AI models and tools through both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

== MCP Java SDK

The Java MCP implementation follows a three-layer architecture:

// [cols="2,10"]
|===
|  |
^a| image::mcp/mcp-stack.svg[MCP Stack Architecture]
a| * *Client/Server Layer*: The McpClient handles client-side and the McpServer manages server-side protocol operations.
Both utilize McpSession for operations
* *Session Layer (McpSession)*: Manages communication patterns and state.
Uses the DefaultMcpSession implementation.
* *Transport Layer (McpTransport)*: Handles JSON-RPC message serialization/deserialization.
Supports multiple transport implementations.

| MCP Client |

a| The MCP Client is a key component in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture, responsible for establishing and managing connections with MCP servers. It implements the client-side of the protocol, handling:

* Protocol version negotiation to ensure compatibility with servers
* Capability negotiation to determine available features
* Message transport and JSON-RPC communication
* Tool discovery and execution
* Resource access and management
* Prompt system interactions
* Optional features like roots management and sampling support
* Synchronous and asynchronous operations
* Multiple transport options:
** Stdio-based transport for process-based communication
** Java HttpClient-based SSE client transport
** WebFlux SSE client transport for reactive HTTP streaming

| MCP Server |

a| The MCP Server is a foundational component in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture that provides tools, resources, and capabilities to clients. It implements the server-side of the protocol, responsible for:

* Exposing tools that clients can discover and execute
* Managing resources with URI-based access patterns
* Providing prompt templates and handling prompt requests
* Supporting capability negotiation with clients
* Implementing server-side protocol operations
* Managing concurrent client connections
* Providing structured logging and notifications
* Supporting both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for flexible integration
* Multiple transport options:
** Stdio-based transport for process-based communication
** Servlet-based SSE server transport
** WebFlux SSE server transport for reactive HTTP streaming
** WebMVC SSE server transport for servlet-based HTTP streaming
