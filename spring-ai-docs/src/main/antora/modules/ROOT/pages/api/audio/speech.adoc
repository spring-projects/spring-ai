= Text-To-Speech (TTS) API

Spring AI provides support for the following Text-To-Speech (TTS) providers:

- xref:api/audio/speech/openai-speech.adoc[OpenAI's Speech API]
- xref:api/audio/speech/elevenlabs-speech.adoc[Eleven Labs Text-To-Speech API]

Future enhancements may introduce additional providers, at which point a common `TextToSpeechModel` and `StreamingTextToSpeechModel` interface will be extracted.
