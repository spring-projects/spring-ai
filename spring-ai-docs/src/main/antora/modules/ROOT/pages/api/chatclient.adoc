[[ChatClient]]
= Chat Client API

The `ChatClient` offers a fluent API for communicating with an AI Model.
It supports both a synchronous and streaming programming model.

The fluent API has methods for building up the constituent parts of a xref:api/prompt.adoc#_prompt[Prompt] that is passed to the AI model as input.
The `Prompt` contains the instructional text to guide the AI model's output and behavior. From the API point of view, prompts consist of a collection of messages.

The AI model processes two main types of messages: user messages, which are direct inputs from the user, and system messages, which are generated by the system to guide the conversation.

These messages often contain placeholders that are substituted at runtime based on user input to customize the response of the AI model to the user input.

There are also Prompt options that can be specified, such as the name of the AI Model to use and the temperature setting that controls the randomness or creativity of the generated output.

== Creating a ChatClient

The `ChatClient` is created using a `ChatClient.Builder` object.
You can obtain an autoconfigured `ChatClient.Builder` instance for any xref:api/chatmodel.adoc[ChatModel] Spring Boot autoconfiguration or create one programmatically.

=== Using an autoconfigured ChatClient.Builder

In the most simple use case, Spring AI provides Spring Boot autoconfiguration, creating a prototype `ChatClient.Builder` bean for you to inject into your class.
Here is a simple example of retrieving a `String` response to a simple user request.

[source,java]
----
@RestController
class MyController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    public MyController(ChatClient.Builder chatClientBuilder) {
        this.chatClient = chatClientBuilder.build();
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai")
    String generation(String userInput) {
        return this.chatClient.prompt()
            .user(userInput)
            .call()
            .content();
    }
}
----

In this simple example, the user input sets the contents of the user message.
The `call()` method sends a request to the AI model, and the `content()` method returns the AI model's response as a `String`.

=== Create a ChatClient programmatically

You can disable the `ChatClient.Builder` autoconfiguration by setting the property `spring.ai.chat.client.enabled=false`.
This is useful if multiple chat models are used together.
Then, create a `ChatClient.Builder` instance programmatically for every `ChatModel` you need:

[source,java]
----
ChatModel myChatModel = ... // usually autowired

ChatClient.Builder builder = ChatClient.builder(this.myChatModel);

// or create a ChatClient with the default builder settings:

ChatClient chatClient = ChatClient.create(this.myChatModel);
----

== ChatClient Fluent API

The `ChatClient` fluent API allows you to create a prompt in three distinct ways using an overloaded `prompt` method to initiate the fluent API:

* `prompt()`: This method with no arguments lets you start using the fluent API, allowing you to build up user, system, and other parts of the prompt.

* `prompt(Prompt prompt)`: This method accepts a `Prompt` argument, letting you pass in a `Prompt` instance that you have created using the Prompt's non-fluent APIs.

* `prompt(String content)`: This is a convenience method similar to the previous overload. It takes the user's text content.

== ChatClient Responses

The `ChatClient` API offers several ways to format the response from the AI Model using the fluent API.

=== Returning a ChatResponse

The response from the AI model is a rich structure defined by the type `xref:api/chatmodel.adoc#ChatResponse[ChatResponse]`.
It includes metadata about how the response was generated and can also contain multiple responses, known as xref:api/chatmodel.adoc#Generation[Generation]s, each with its own metadata.
The metadata includes the number of tokens (each token is approximately 3/4 of a word) used to create the response.
This information is important because hosted AI models charge based on the number of tokens used per request.

An example to return the `ChatResponse` object that contains the metadata is shown below by invoking `chatResponse()` after the `call()` method.

[source,java]
----
ChatResponse chatResponse = chatClient.prompt()
    .user("Tell me a joke")
    .call()
    .chatResponse();
----


=== Returning an Entity

You often want to return an entity class that is mapped from the returned `String`.
The `entity()` method provides this functionality.

For example, given the Java record:

[source,java]
----
record ActorFilms(String actor, List<String> movies) {}
----

You can easily map the AI model's output to this record using the `entity()` method, as shown below:

[source,java]
----
ActorFilms actorFilms = chatClient.prompt()
    .user("Generate the filmography for a random actor.")
    .call()
    .entity(ActorFilms.class);
----

There is also an overloaded `entity` method with the signature `entity(ParameterizedTypeReference<T> type)` that lets you specify types such as generic Lists:

[source,java]
----
List<ActorFilms> actorFilms = chatClient.prompt()
    .user("Generate the filmography of 5 movies for Tom Hanks and Bill Murray.")
    .call()
    .entity(new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<ActorFilms>>() {});
----

=== Streaming Responses

The `stream()` method lets you get an asynchronous response as shown below:

[source,java]
----

Flux<String> output = chatClient.prompt()
    .user("Tell me a joke")
    .stream()
    .content();
----

You can also stream the `ChatResponse` using the method `Flux<ChatResponse> chatResponse()`.

In the future, we will offer a convenience method that will let you return a Java entity with the reactive `stream()` method.
In the meantime, you should use the xref:api/structured-output-converter.adoc#StructuredOutputConverter[Structured Output Converter] to convert the aggregated response explicity as shown below.
This also demonstrates the use of parameters in the fluent API that will be discussed in more detail in a later section of the documentation.

[source,java]
----
var converter = new BeanOutputConverter<>(new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<ActorsFilms>>() {});

Flux<String> flux = this.chatClient.prompt()
    .user(u -> u.text("""
                        Generate the filmography for a random actor.
                        {format}
                      """)
            .param("format", this.converter.getFormat()))
    .stream()
    .content();

String content = this.flux.collectList().block().stream().collect(Collectors.joining());

List<ActorFilms> actorFilms = this.converter.convert(this.content);
----

== Prompt Templates

The `ChatClient` fluent API lets you provide user and system text as templates with variables that are replaced at runtime.

[source,java]
----
String answer = ChatClient.create(chatModel).prompt()
    .user(u -> u
            .text("Tell me the names of 5 movies whose soundtrack was composed by {composer}")
            .param("composer", "John Williams"))
    .call()
    .content();
----

Internally, the ChatClient uses the `PromptTemplate` class to handle the user and system text and replace the variables with the values provided at runtime relying on a given `TemplateRenderer` implementation.
By default, Spring AI uses the `StTemplateRenderer` implementation, which is based on the open-source https://www.stringtemplate.org/[StringTemplate] engine developed by Terence Parr.

Spring AI also provides a `NoOpTemplateRenderer` for cases where no template processing is desired.

Spring AI also provides a `NoOpTemplateRenderer`.

NOTE: The `TemplateRenderer` configured directly on the `ChatClient` (via `.templateRenderer()`) applies only to the prompt content defined directly in the `ChatClient` builder chain (e.g., via `.user()`, `.system()`).
It does *not* affect templates used internally by xref:api/retrieval-augmented-generation.adoc#_questionansweradvisor[Advisors] like `QuestionAnswerAdvisor`, which have their own template customization mechanisms (see xref:api/retrieval-augmented-generation.adoc#_custom_template[Custom Advisor Templates]).

If you'd rather use a different template engine, you can provide a custom implementation of the `TemplateRenderer` interface directly to the ChatClient. You can also keep using the default `StTemplateRenderer`, but with a custom configuration.

For example, by default, template variables are identified by the `{}` syntax. If you're planning to include JSON in your prompt, you might want to use a different syntax to avoid conflicts with JSON syntax. For example, you can use the `<` and `>` delimiters.

[source,java]
----
String answer = ChatClient.create(chatModel).prompt()
    .user(u -> u
            .text("Tell me the names of 5 movies whose soundtrack was composed by <composer>")
            .param("composer", "John Williams"))
    .templateRenderer(StTemplateRenderer.builder().startDelimiterToken('<').endDelimiterToken('>').build())
    .call()
    .content();
----

== call() return values

After specifying the `call()` method on `ChatClient`, there are a few different options for the response type.

* `String content()`: returns the String content of the response
* `ChatResponse chatResponse()`: returns the `ChatResponse` object that contains multiple generations and also metadata about the response, for example how many token were used to create the response.
* `ChatClientResponse chatClientResponse()`: returns a `ChatClientResponse` object that contains the `ChatResponse` object and the ChatClient execution context, giving you access to additional data used during the execution of advisors (e.g. the relevant documents retrieved in a RAG flow).
* `entity()` to return a Java type
** `entity(ParameterizedTypeReference<T> type)`: used to return a `Collection` of entity types.
** `entity(Class<T> type)`:  used to return a specific entity type.
** `entity(StructuredOutputConverter<T> structuredOutputConverter)`: used to specify an instance of a `StructuredOutputConverter` to convert a `String` to an entity type.

You can also invoke the `stream()` method instead of `call()`.

== stream() return values

After specifying the `stream()` method on `ChatClient`, there are a few options for the response type:

* `Flux<String> content()`: Returns a `Flux` of the string being generated by the AI model.
* `Flux<ChatResponse> chatResponse()`: Returns a `Flux` of the `ChatResponse` object, which contains additional metadata about the response.
* `Flux<ChatClientResponse> chatClientResponse()`: returns a `Flux` of the `ChatClientResponse` object that contains the `ChatResponse` object and the ChatClient execution context, giving you access to additional data used during the execution of advisors (e.g. the relevant documents retrieved in a RAG flow).

== Using Defaults

Creating a `ChatClient` with a default system text in an `@Configuration` class simplifies runtime code.
By setting defaults, you only need to specify the user text when calling `ChatClient`, eliminating the need to set a system text for each request in your runtime code path.

=== Default System Text

In the following example, we will configure the system text to always reply in a pirate's voice.
To avoid repeating the system text in runtime code, we will create a `ChatClient` instance in a `@Configuration` class.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
class Config {

    @Bean
    ChatClient chatClient(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
        return builder.defaultSystem("You are a friendly chat bot that answers question in the voice of a Pirate")
                .build();
    }

}
----

and a `@RestController` to invoke it:

[source,java]
----
@RestController
class AIController {

	private final ChatClient chatClient;

	AIController(ChatClient chatClient) {
		this.chatClient = chatClient;
	}

	@GetMapping("/ai/simple")
	public Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
		return Map.of("completion", this.chatClient.prompt().user(message).call().content());
	}
}
----

When calling the application endpoint via curl, the result is:

[source,bash]
----
❯ curl localhost:8080/ai/simple
{"completion":"Why did the pirate go to the comedy club? To hear some arrr-rated jokes! Arrr, matey!"}
----

=== Default System Text with parameters

In the following example, we will use a placeholder in the system text to specify the voice of the completion at runtime instead of design time.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
class Config {

    @Bean
    ChatClient chatClient(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
        return builder.defaultSystem("You are a friendly chat bot that answers question in the voice of a {voice}")
                .build();
    }

}
----

[source,java]
----
@RestController
class AIController {
	private final ChatClient chatClient;

	AIController(ChatClient chatClient) {
		this.chatClient = chatClient;
	}

	@GetMapping("/ai")
	Map<String, String> completion(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message, String voice) {
		return Map.of("completion",
				this.chatClient.prompt()
						.system(sp -> sp.param("voice", voice))
						.user(message)
						.call()
						.content());
	}

}
----

When calling the application endpoint via httpie, the result is:

[source.bash]
----
http localhost:8080/ai voice=='Robert DeNiro'
{
    "completion": "You talkin' to me? Okay, here's a joke for ya: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two tired! Classic, right?"
}
----

=== Other defaults

At the `ChatClient.Builder` level, you can specify the default prompt configuration.

* `defaultOptions(ChatOptions chatOptions)`: Pass in either portable options defined in the `ChatOptions` class or model-specific options such as those in `OpenAiChatOptions`. For more information on model-specific `ChatOptions` implementations, refer to the JavaDocs.

* `defaultFunction(String name, String description, java.util.function.Function<I, O> function)`: The `name` is used to refer to the function in user text. The `description` explains the function's purpose and helps the AI model choose the correct function for an accurate response. The `function` argument is a Java function instance that the model will execute when necessary.

* `defaultFunctions(String... functionNames)`: The bean names of `java.util.Function`s defined in the application context.

* `defaultUser(String text)`, `defaultUser(Resource text)`, `defaultUser(Consumer<UserSpec> userSpecConsumer)`: These methods let you define the user text. The `Consumer<UserSpec>` allows you to use a lambda to specify the user text and any default parameters.

* `defaultAdvisors(Advisor... advisor)`: Advisors allow modification of the data used to create the `Prompt`. The `QuestionAnswerAdvisor` implementation enables the pattern of `Retrieval Augmented Generation` by appending the prompt with context information related to the user text.

* `defaultAdvisors(Consumer<AdvisorSpec> advisorSpecConsumer)`: This method allows you to define a `Consumer` to configure multiple advisors using the `AdvisorSpec`. Advisors can modify the data used to create the final `Prompt`. The `Consumer<AdvisorSpec>` lets you specify a lambda to add advisors, such as `QuestionAnswerAdvisor`, which supports `Retrieval Augmented Generation` by appending the prompt with relevant context information based on the user text.

You can override these defaults at runtime using the corresponding methods without the `default` prefix.

* `options(ChatOptions chatOptions)`

* `function(String name, String description,
java.util.function.Function<I, O> function)`

* `functions(String... functionNames)`

* `user(String text)`, `user(Resource text)`, `user(Consumer<UserSpec> userSpecConsumer)`

* `advisors(Advisor... advisor)`

* `advisors(Consumer<AdvisorSpec> advisorSpecConsumer)`

== Advisors

The xref:api/advisors.adoc[Advisors API] provides a flexible and powerful way to intercept, modify, and enhance AI-driven interactions in your Spring applications. 

A common pattern when calling an AI model with user text is to append or augment the prompt with contextual data.

This contextual data can be of different types. Common types include:

* **Your own data**: This is data the AI model hasn't been trained on. Even if the model has seen similar data, the appended contextual data takes precedence in generating the response.

* **Conversational history**: The chat model's API is stateless. If you tell the AI model your name, it won't remember it in subsequent interactions. Conversational history must be sent with each request to ensure previous interactions are considered when generating a response.


=== Advisor Configuration in ChatClient

The ChatClient fluent API provides an `AdvisorSpec` interface for configuring advisors. This interface offers methods to add parameters, set multiple parameters at once, and add one or more advisors to the chain.

[source,java]
----
interface AdvisorSpec {
    AdvisorSpec param(String k, Object v);
    AdvisorSpec params(Map<String, Object> p);
    AdvisorSpec advisors(Advisor... advisors);
    AdvisorSpec advisors(List<Advisor> advisors);
}
----

IMPORTANT: The order in which advisors are added to the chain is crucial, as it determines the sequence of their execution. Each advisor modifies the prompt or the context in some way, and the changes made by one advisor are passed on to the next in the chain.

[source,java]
----
ChatClient.builder(chatModel)
    .build()
    .prompt()
    .advisors(
        new MessageChatMemoryAdvisor(chatMemory),
        new QuestionAnswerAdvisor(vectorStore)
    )
    .user(userText)
    .call()
    .content();
----

In this configuration, the `MessageChatMemoryAdvisor` will be executed first, adding the conversation history to the prompt. Then, the `QuestionAnswerAdvisor` will perform its search based on the user's question and the added conversation history, potentially providing more relevant results.

xref:ROOT:api/retrieval-augmented-generation.adoc#_questionansweradvisor[Learn about Question Answer Advisor]

TIP: Refer to the xref:api/chat-memory.adoc[Chat Memory] documentation for more information on how to use the `ChatMemory` interface to manage conversation history in combination with the advisors.

The following advisor implementations use the `ChatMemory` interface to advice the prompt with conversation history which differ in the details of how the memory is added to the prompt

* `MessageChatMemoryAdvisor` :  Memory is retrieved and added as a collection of messages to the prompt
* `PromptChatMemoryAdvisor` :  Memory is retrieved and added into the prompt's system text.
* `VectorStoreChatMemoryAdvisor`  : The constructor `VectorStoreChatMemoryAdvisor(VectorStore vectorStore, String defaultConversationId, int chatHistoryWindowSize, int order)`  This constructor allows you to:

. Specify the VectorStore instance used for managing and querying documents.
. Set a default conversation ID to be used if none is provided in the context.
. Define the window size for chat history retrieval in terms of token size.
. Provide system text advice used for the chat advisor system.
. Set the order of precedence for this advisor in the chain.


The `VectorStoreChatMemoryAdvisor.builder()` method lets you specify the default conversation ID, the chat history window size, and the order of the chat history to be retrieved.

A sample `@Service` implementation that uses several advisors is shown below.

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.ai.chat.client.advisor.AbstractChatMemoryAdvisor.CHAT_MEMORY_CONVERSATION_ID_KEY;
import static org.springframework.ai.chat.client.advisor.AbstractChatMemoryAdvisor.CHAT_MEMORY_RETRIEVE_SIZE_KEY;

@Service
public class CustomerSupportAssistant {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    public CustomerSupportAssistant(ChatClient.Builder builder, VectorStore vectorStore, ChatMemory chatMemory) {

        this.chatClient = builder
            .defaultSystem("""
                    You are a customer chat support agent of an airline named "Funnair". Respond in a friendly,
                    helpful, and joyful manner.

                    Before providing information about a booking or cancelling a booking, you MUST always
                    get the following information from the user: booking number, customer first name and last name.

                    Before changing a booking you MUST ensure it is permitted by the terms.

                    If there is a charge for the change, you MUST ask the user to consent before proceeding.
                    """)
            .defaultAdvisors(
                    new MessageChatMemoryAdvisor(chatMemory), // CHAT MEMORY
                    new QuestionAnswerAdvisor(vectorStore), // RAG
                    new SimpleLoggerAdvisor())
            .defaultFunctions("getBookingDetails", "changeBooking", "cancelBooking") // FUNCTION CALLING
            .build();
    }

    public Flux<String> chat(String chatId, String userMessageContent) {

        return this.chatClient.prompt()
                .user(userMessageContent)
                .advisors(a -> a
                        .param(CHAT_MEMORY_CONVERSATION_ID_KEY, chatId)
                        .param(CHAT_MEMORY_RETRIEVE_SIZE_KEY, 100))
                .stream().content();
    }

}
----

xref:ROOT:api/retrieval-augmented-generation.adoc#_questionansweradvisor[Learn about Question Answer Advisor]

=== Retrieval Augmented Generation

Refer to the xref:ROOT:api/retrieval-augmented-generation.adoc[Retrieval Augmented Generation] guide.

=== Logging

The `SimpleLoggerAdvisor` is an advisor that logs the `request` and `response` data of the `ChatClient`.
This can be useful for debugging and monitoring your AI interactions.

TIP: Spring AI supports observability for LLM and vector store interactions. Refer to the xref:observability/index.adoc[Observability] guide for more information.

To enable logging, add the `SimpleLoggerAdvisor` to the advisor chain when creating your ChatClient.
It's recommended to add it toward the end of the chain:

[source,java]
----
ChatResponse response = ChatClient.create(chatModel).prompt()
        .advisors(new SimpleLoggerAdvisor())
        .user("Tell me a joke?")
        .call()
        .chatResponse();
----

To see the logs, set the logging level for the advisor package to `DEBUG`:

----
logging.level.org.springframework.ai.chat.client.advisor=DEBUG
----

Add this to your `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file.

You can customize what data from `AdvisedRequest` and `ChatResponse` is logged by using the following constructor:

[source,java]
----
SimpleLoggerAdvisor(
    Function<AdvisedRequest, String> requestToString,
    Function<ChatResponse, String> responseToString
)
----

Example usage:

[source,java]
----
SimpleLoggerAdvisor customLogger = new SimpleLoggerAdvisor(
    request -> "Custom request: " + request.userText,
    response -> "Custom response: " + response.getResult()
);
----

This allows you to tailor the logged information to your specific needs.

TIP: Be cautious about logging sensitive information in production environments.

== Chat Memory

The interface `ChatMemory` represents a storage for chat conversation history. It provides methods to add messages to a conversation, retrieve messages from a conversation, and clear the conversation history.

There is currently one implementation: `MessageWindowChatMemory`.

`MessageWindowChatMemory` is a chat memory implementation that maintains a window of messages up to a specified maximum size (default: 20 messages). When the number of messages exceeds this limit, older messages are evicted, but system messages are preserved. If a new system message is added, all previous system messages are removed from memory. This ensures that the most recent context is always available for the conversation while keeping memory usage bounded.


The `MessageWindowChatMemory` is backed by the `ChatMemoryRepository` abstraction which provides storage implementations for the chat conversation history. There are several implementations available, including the `InMemoryChatMemoryRepository`, `JdbcChatMemoryRepository`, `CassandraChatMemoryRepository` and `Neo4jChatMemoryRepository`.

This implementation is the default for conversation history management in Spring AI. For more details and usage examples, see the xref:api/chat-memory.adoc[Chat Memory] section.
