= MCP Server Boot Starter

link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts[Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers] are programs that expose specific capabilities to AI applications through standardized protocol interfaces. 
Each server provides focused functionality for a particular domain.

The Spring AI MCP Server Boot Starters provide auto-configuration for setting up link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts[MCP Servers] in Spring Boot applications. 
They enable seamless integration of MCP server capabilities with Spring Boot's auto-configuration system.

The MCP Server Boot Starters offer:

* Automatic configuration of MCP server components, including tools, resources, and prompts
* Support for different MCP protocol versions, including STDIO, SSE, Streamable-HTTP, and stateless servers
* Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes
* Multiple transport layer options
* Flexible tool, resource, and prompt specification
* Change notification capabilities

== Sync/Async Server API Options

* **Synchronous Server** - The default server type implemented using `McpSyncServer`.
It is designed for straightforward request-response patterns in your applications.
To enable this server type, set `spring.ai.mcp.server.type=SYNC` in your configuration.
When activated, it automatically handles the configuration of synchronous tool specifications.

* **Asynchronous Server** - The asynchronous server implementation uses `McpAsyncServer` and is optimized for non-blocking operations.
To enable this server type, configure your application with `spring.ai.mcp.server.type=ASYNC`.
This server type automatically sets up asynchronous tool specifications with built-in Project Reactor support.

== Server Capabilities

Depending on the server and transport types, MCP Servers can support various capabilities, such as:

* **Tools** - Allows servers to expose tools that can be invoked by language models
* **Resources** - Provides a standardized way for servers to expose resources to clients
* **Prompts** - Provides a standardized way for servers to expose prompt templates to clients
* **Utility/Completions** - Provides a standardized way for servers to offer argument autocompletion suggestions for prompts and resource URIs
* **Utility/Logging** - Provides a standardized way for servers to send structured log messages to clients
* **Utility/Progress** - Optional progress tracking for long-running operations through notification messages
* **Utility/Ping** - Optional health check mechanism for the server to report its status

All capabilities are enabled by default. Disabling a capability will prevent the server from registering and exposing the corresponding features to clients.

== Transport Options

MCP Servers support multiple transport mechanisms, each with its dedicated starter:

* Standard Input/Output (STDIO) - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server`
* SSE Spring MVC - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-webmvc`
* SSE Spring WebFlux (Reactive) - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-webflux`
* Streamable-HTTP Spring MVC - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-streamable-webmvc`
* Streamable-HTTP Spring WebFlux (Reactive) - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-streamable-webflux`
* Stateless Spring MVC - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-stateless-webmvc`
* Stateless Spring WebFlux (Reactive) - `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-stateless-webflux`
