= Speech Model API

[NOTE]
====
This page has been superseded by the new Text-to-Speech (TTS) documentation.

Please refer to xref:api/audio/speech.adoc[Text-To-Speech (TTS) API] for the current shared interfaces (`TextToSpeechModel` and `StreamingTextToSpeechModel`).

The old provider-specific classes (`SpeechModel`, `StreamingSpeechModel`, `SpeechPrompt`, `SpeechResponse`) have been removed in favor of shared interfaces that work across all TTS providers (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and future providers).
