== What is a Recursive Advisor?

Recursive advisors are a special type of advisor that can loop through the downstream advisor chain multiple times. 
This pattern is useful when you need to repeatedly call the LLM until a certain condition is met, such as:

* Executing tool calls in a loop until no more tools need to be called
* Validating structured output and retrying if validation fails
* Implementing Evaluation logic with modifications to the request
* Implementing retry logic with modifications to the request

The `CallAdvisorChain.copy(CallAdvisor after)` method is the key utility that enables recursive advisor patterns. 
It creates a new advisor chain that contains only the advisors that come after the specified advisor in the original chain
and allows the recursive advisor to call this sub-chain as needed.
This approach ensures that:

* The recursive advisor can loop through the remaining advisors in the chain
* Other advisors in the chain can observe and intercept each iteration
* The advisor chain maintains proper ordering and observability
* The recursive advisor doesn't re-execute advisors that came before it

== Built-in Recursive Advisors

Spring AI provides two built-in recursive advisors that demonstrate this pattern:

=== ToolCallAdvisor

The `ToolCallAdvisor` implements the tool calling loop as part of the advisor chain, rather than relying on the model's internal tool execution. This enables other advisors in the chain to intercept and observe the tool calling process.

Key features:

* Disables the model's internal tool execution by setting `setInternalToolExecutionEnabled(false)`
* Loops through the advisor chain until no more tool calls are present
* Supports "return direct" functionality - when a tool execution has `returnDirect=true`, it interrupts the tool calling loop and returns the tool execution result directly to the client application instead of sending it back to the LLM
* Uses `callAdvisorChain.copy(this)` to create a sub-chain for recursive calls
* Includes null safety checks to handle cases where the chat response might be null

Example usage:

[source,java]
----
var toolCallAdvisor = ToolCallAdvisor.builder()
    .toolCallingManager(toolCallingManager)
    .advisorOrder(BaseAdvisor.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 300)
    .build();

var chatClient = ChatClient.builder(chatModel)
    .defaultAdvisors(toolCallAdvisor)
    .build();
----

==== Return Direct Functionality

The "return direct" feature allows tools to bypass the LLM and return their results directly to the client application. This is useful when:

* The tool's output is the final answer and doesn't need LLM processing
* You want to reduce latency by avoiding an additional LLM call
* The tool result should be returned as-is without interpretation

When a tool execution has `returnDirect=true`, the `ToolCallAdvisor` will:

1. Execute the tool call as normal
2. Detect the `returnDirect` flag in the `ToolExecutionResult`
3. Break out of the tool calling loop
4. Return the tool execution result directly to the client application as a `ChatResponse` with the tool's output as the generation content

=== StructuredOutputValidationAdvisor

The `StructuredOutputValidationAdvisor` validates the structured JSON output against a generated JSON schema and retries the call if validation fails, up to a specified number of attempts.

Key features:

* Automatically generates a JSON schema from the expected output type
* Validates the LLM response against the schema
* Retries the call if validation fails, up to a configurable number of attempts
* Augments the prompt with validation error messages on retry attempts to help the LLM correct its output
* Uses `callAdvisorChain.copy(this)` to create a sub-chain for recursive calls
* Optionally supports a custom `ObjectMapper` for JSON processing

Example usage:

[source,java]
----
var validationAdvisor = StructuredOutputValidationAdvisor.builder()
    .outputType(MyResponseType.class)
    .maxRepeatAttempts(3)
    .advisorOrder(BaseAdvisor.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 1000)
    .build();

var chatClient = ChatClient.builder(chatModel)
    .defaultAdvisors(validationAdvisor)
    .build();
