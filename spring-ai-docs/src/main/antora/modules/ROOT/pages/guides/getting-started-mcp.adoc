= Getting Started with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI applications interact with external tools and resources.

Spring joined the MCP ecosystem early as a key contributor, helping to develop and maintain the link:https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk[official MCP Java SDK] that serves as the foundation for Java-based MCP implementations. Building on this contribution, Spring AI provides comprehensive MCP support through Boot Starters and annotations, making it easy to build both MCP servers and clients.

Start here for an introductory overview of the Model Context Protocol, explaining core concepts and architecture.

== Complete Tutorial and Source Code

**ðŸ“– Blog Tutorial:** link:https://spring.io/blog/2025/09/16/connect-your-ai-to-everything-spring-ais-mcp-boot-starters[Connect Your AI to Everything: Spring AI's MCP Boot Starters]

The tutorial provides comprehensive coverage of MCP development with Spring AI, including production-ready examples, advanced features, and deployment patterns. All code examples below are taken from this tutorial.

== Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with Spring AI's annotation-based approach. The following examples are from the blog tutorial:

=== Simple MCP Server

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class WeatherService {

    @McpTool(description = "Get current temperature for a location")
    public String getTemperature(
            @McpToolParam(description = "City name", required = true) String city) {
        return String.format("Current temperature in %s: 22Â°C", city);
    }
}
----

Add the dependency and configure:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-webmvc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,properties]
----
spring.ai.mcp.server.protocol=STREAMABLE
----

=== Simple MCP Client

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner demo(ChatClient chatClient, ToolCallbackProvider mcpTools) {
    return args -> {
        String response = chatClient
            .prompt("What's the weather like in Paris?")
            .toolCallbacks(mcpTools)
            .call()
            .content();
        System.out.println(response);
    };
}
----

Configure the client connection:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  ai:
    mcp:
      client:
        streamable-http:
          connections:
            weather-server:
              url: http://localhost:8080

== Additional Examples Repository

Beyond the tutorial examples, the link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol[Spring AI Examples] repository contains numerous MCP implementations.

=== Recommended Starting Points

*Annotation-based examples* (recommended for best developer experience):

== Key Concepts

**MCP Servers** expose capabilities (tools, resources, prompts) to AI applications.
**MCP Clients** connect AI applications to MCP servers.

**Transport Options:**
* *STDIO* - Desktop applications, IDE integrations
* *Streamable-HTTP* - Production deployments, microservices
* *SSE* - Real-time web applications
* *Stateless* - Serverless environments

**Why Annotations?**
* Declarative approach - focus on business logic
* Automatic JSON schema generation
* Type-safe parameter handling
* Spring Boot auto-configuration
* Minimal boilerplate code
