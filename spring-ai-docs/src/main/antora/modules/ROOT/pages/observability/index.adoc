= Observability

Spring AI builds upon the observability features in the Spring ecosystem to provide insights into AI-related operations.
Spring AI provides metrics and tracing capabilities for its core components: `ChatClient` (including `Advisor`),
`ChatModel`, `EmbeddingModel`, `ImageModel`, and `VectorStore`.

NOTE: Low cardinality keys will be added to metrics and traces, while high cardinality keys will only be added to traces.

[WARNING]
====
**1.0.0-RC1 Breaking Changes** 

Following configuration properties have been renamed to better reflect their purpose:

* `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.include-prompt` → `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.log-prompt`

== Chat Client

The `spring.ai.chat.client` observations are recorded when a ChatClient `call()` or `stream()` operations are invoked. 
They measure the time spent performing the invocation and propagate the related tracing information.
