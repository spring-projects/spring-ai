= Observability

Spring AI builds upon the observability features in the Spring ecosystem to provide insights into AI-related operations.
Spring AI provides metrics and tracing capabilities for its core components: `ChatClient` (including `Advisor`),
`ChatModel`, `EmbeddingModel`, `ImageModel`, and `VectorStore`.

NOTE: Low cardinality keys will be added to metrics and traces, while high cardinality keys will only be added to traces.

== Chat Client

The `spring.ai.chat.client` observations are recorded when a ChatClient `call()` or `stream()` operations are invoked. 
They measure the time spent performing the invocation and propagate the related tracing information.

=== Prompt Content

The `ChatClient` prompt content is typically big and possibly containing sensitive information.
For those reasons, it is not exported by default.

Spring AI supports exporting the prompt content as span attributes/events across all tracing backends.

[cols="6,3,1", stripes=even]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.include-prompt` |  Whether to include the chat client prompt content in the observations. | `false`
|====

WARNING: If you enable the inclusion of the chat client prompt content in the observations, there's a risk of exposing sensitive or private information. Please, be careful!

=== Input Data (Deprecated)

WARNING: The `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.include-input` property is deprecated, replaced by `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.include-prompt`. See xref:_prompt_content[Prompt Content].

The `ChatClient` input data is typically big and possibly containing sensitive information.
For those reasons, it is not exported by default.

Spring AI supports exporting input data as span attributes/events across all tracing backends.

[cols="6,3,1", stripes=even]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| `spring.ai.chat.client.observations.include-input` |  Whether to include the input content in the observations. | `false`

WARNING: If you enable the inclusion of the input content in the observations, there's a risk of exposing sensitive or private information. Please, be careful!

=== Chat Client Advisors

The `spring.ai.advisor` observations are recorded when an advisor is executed.
They measure the time spent in the advisor (including the time spend on the inner advisors) and propagate the related tracing information.
