/**
 * The org.sf.ai.chat package represents the bounded context for the Chat Model within the
 * AI generative model domain. This package extends the core domain defined in
 * org.sf.ai.generative, providing implementations specific to chat-based generative AI
 * interactions.
 *
 * In line with Domain-Driven Design principles, this package includes implementations of
 * entities and value objects specific to the chat context, such as ChatPrompt and
 * ChatResponse, adhering to the ubiquitous language of chat interactions in AI models.
 *
 * This bounded context is designed to encapsulate all aspects of chat-based AI
 * functionalities, maintaining a clear boundary from other contexts within the AI domain.
