/**
 * The FactCheckingEvaluator class implements a method for evaluating the factual accuracy
 * of Large Language Model (LLM) responses against provided context.
 *
 * This evaluator addresses a specific type of potential error in LLM outputs known as
 * "hallucination" in the context of grounded factuality. It verifies whether a given
 * statement (the "claim") is logically supported by a provided context (the "document").
 *
 * Key concepts: - Document: The context or grounding information against which the claim
 * is checked. - Claim: The statement to be verified against the document.
 *
 * The evaluator uses a prompt-based approach with a separate, typically smaller and more
 * efficient LLM to perform the fact-checking. This design choice allows for
 * cost-effective and rapid verification, which is crucial when evaluating longer LLM
 * outputs that may require multiple verification steps.
 *
 * Implementation note: For efficient and accurate fact-checking, consider using
 * specialized models like Bespoke-Minicheck, a grounded factuality checking model
 * developed by Bespoke Labs and available in Ollama. Such models are specifically
 * designed to fact-check responses generated by other models, helping to detect and
 * reduce hallucinations. For more information, see:
 * <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/reduce-hallucinations-with-bespoke-minicheck">Reduce
 * Hallucinations with Bespoke-Minicheck</a> and the research paper:
 * <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10774v1">MiniCheck: An Efficient Method for LLM
 * Hallucination Detection</a>
 *
 * Note: This evaluator is specifically designed to fact-check statements against given
 * information. It's not meant for other types of accuracy tests, like quizzing an AI on
 * obscure facts without giving it any reference material to work with (so-called 'closed
 * book' scenarios).
 *
 * The evaluation process aims to determine if the claim is supported by the document,
 * returning a boolean result indicating whether the fact-check passed or failed.
